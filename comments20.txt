evianGOWlover: the best trilogy of all time<3﻿Nick sysysyy: I know I am a bit late in becoming a LOTR fan. I have a few questions if 
any of you would be kind enough to answer. Question number 1) How many 
types of " races " happen to be in this trilogy?
2) Who are/is Valar? 3) I know the lluvatar is like God, so why won't he 
kill Sauron to end all this? 4) Who created Sauron in the first place? 5) 
Why didn't Sauron turn the 3 Elven Rings " evil " ? 6) Are all the movies 
the same plot? Are they all 1 adventure cut into three pieces? 
My last question: Can anyone write a list of every important character and 
define them? Who they are or what they are supposed to do?

This would be massive help to me, I started yesterday evening (12 hours 
ago), so I am missing some crucial answers.

Thank you﻿Sherry P.: It never gets old. 👍﻿MiyuChan: I remember when the movie came out. I was so excited and couldnt wait to 
see it. I was sure though I wouldnt see it on opening day. That day, after 
I got home from school, I relaxed at home for a bit but then mom and dad 
said they were going to see a movie and told me to come along. I knew 
though it wouldnt be Return of the King since they never saw the other 
movies. But when we got to the theatre and got our tickets they said the 
movie and I just jumped up and down in excitement.

We had to wait in line for an hour and a half in front of the theatre. The 
people coming out from the previous showing were cheering and I knew it 
would be good. 3 and a half hours later, I came out with a huge smile on my 
face and almost crying.

I still watch the films to this day. :)﻿Randomstuff176: No offence but luckily there were no jews to ruin this film!!!﻿Voice .Nerd: Sorry guys but this trilogy was FAR more superior to Harry Potter's 8 
films...

FAN DEBATE!!!!﻿Tlevids: No Denethor or Faramir? Seriously?﻿Resimaster: Easily one of the BEST trailers (and films) in cinema history.﻿Im Drift: star wars is better though?﻿Guard655: These movies will never become old, the CGI is not very much in these 
movies, and the CGI there is, is very good. These movies will live for MANY 
years. They are perfect.﻿iamSnip3rOne: Now its a decade old. for such a film, this doesnt look a day old! :D﻿Garrus Vakarian: One of the few movies that are way better that the trailers. I mean its 
like the movie is divine stuff and trailers suck :D﻿Rory Lennon: best film of all time.﻿Poffo Ortiz: My god... this trailer is amazing. The Return of the King has to be one of 
the greatest movies of all time! Seeing this trailer just brings it all 
back for me. It was the winter of 2003, i had just graduated college and i 
saw it with my roommate, a girl i was dating and my mom and i swear i 
must've cried at least 3 times throughout. Especially at the end, when Sam 
carries Frodo up the side of Mount Doom.. holyshit, i was balling! I loved 
everything about it, it was so goddamned entertaining and engaging; a 
completely emotional experience. The action, the drama, the music, the 
make-up, the incredible visual effects and the realism of Gollum... i could 
go on and on. After waiting so long and seeing each film every Christmas, i 
felt like I'd experienced the journey with them, i felt so connected to all 
the characters. The build up and the excitement was insane. These films are 
truly a masterpiece. I'm really enjoying the Hobbit now as well and they 
seem to be getting better with each film, but i think i will always be 
partial to LOTR's. May the Maiar bless you Peter Jackson for what you have 
created and may your work always be remembered and revered for all time Mr. 
Tolkien. Truly, you were a literary genius! Thank you for sharing 
your books with the world.﻿Jameson Grilley: I really really love the hobbit movies and coming from a person who read 
the books first and preferred the hobbit these new movies dont feel to me 
like say the star wars prequels as they do to others. I like the lighter 
tone but I wish it were more serious at times. I really do it never feels 
like theyre in any danger, just when i feel like the new one is more in 
line with lotr a fucking dwarf starts taking out orcs by rolling a barrel 
over them. Like come on youre not letting me feel the emotions i felt in 
lotr when it was like they werent going to succeed. Also wtf was that 
liquid gold about man come one. I was so in love with that movie until that 
scene. In awe of Cumbies performance and feeling bilbos fear in my heart 
and then swoop they pull the rug out from under my by balancing thorin on 
the nose of a 200 ft tall  fucking dragon and riding a wheel barrel. I was 
literally cringing and thinking why o why did you just ruin it for me.﻿PoisonHW: I know those movies by heart, but even the trailers give me chills. 
They are the bests of all time.﻿Somar29: Rewatching this film, does anyone feel that the Hobbit films feel and look 
low budget in comparison, they also feel too family friendly with the 
choice of music and jokes. ﻿Rick Z.: Wow the trailer is awesome but the movie is even better. You don't see that 
very often﻿iamSnip3rOne: This cinematic masterpiece, unrivaled, will be ten years old in 15

$$$$lolumadbro69: This movie wasnt... that great? good acting and all but man a dull story﻿Ivo Teixeira: If you liked Fargo, you'll probably like this one... but if you didn't 
(like me) you will not.
It's not the begining, nor the end of a story, it's the middle of one. 
There's some great acting, but it's (in my view) wasted in a uninteresting 
plot and a uneventful story. There's some interesting dialogues, a lot of 
killing and lots of blood, however there's no action, no drama, no 
thrill... But it did won an Oscar (not that means anything nowadays), so I 
leave it up to you...
See it and judge for yourselves.﻿john bayern: One of the best acting i have ever seen by Javier Bardem! The next one by 
Christoph Waltz at Inglourious Basterds!﻿midnight15086: I hate cheesy, corny, dumb happy endings.  I  love this movie so much. 
 It's gritty and tense.  All the actors were so good even the little 
supporting roles, and Bardem was awesome as Chigurh.  It's not formulaic, 
it's not predictable, it's not a feel good movie.  It reminds me of the 
tone of a lot of foreign non-Hollywood movies.  ﻿TigreLoko24: Is this movie worth it (Blu-ray) Used for $4.83?? I plan on buying it to

action thriller and then it ends you realize you were watching a drama with 
a commentary on life and it's stages. The end angered me and then about 20 
min later it clicked and now I can't wait to watch it again ﻿HAWDENG Hawrame: Actors in this film performed so well, the got nominated for an award﻿panchotheaddict420: Talk about about being cheated out of a great movie! Fuck you the guy who 
wrote this story u fucking buzzkill﻿Duckfancomedy: Call it﻿UnknownJanjer: "Stelio Kontos...Stelio Kontos..."﻿Gina Marie: What was up with the ending of this damned movie? I was so pissed at the 
ending, the movie was excellent up until then. Any ending is better than NO 
ending. It's like the movie ended in the middle! I also hated that you know 
who got killed (in case you haven't seen it, not saying who), but they 
never showed his body so I thought it was a faked death right up until the 
credits rolled. WTF??? A bad ending, a sad ending, a happy ending, but SOME 
damned ending, would have been nice. This is what I watched last night, any 
suggestions for tonight and please, nothing this screwed up. i really loved 
this movie until then too, lol.﻿Kenneth H. Griffin: *FATHER-ALL-AMERICAN-FOOTBALL-PLAYER-DENNIS-PATRICK-ANTON-AL-SUGORE-GRIFFIN*

$$$$rabia alesgerova: I need to feel strongly, to love and admire, just as desperately as I need 
to breathe-Jean Dominique Bauby ﻿Isabella Montoya: ﻿Grant Ford: NoneAngela Ronson: Ppl may not know who Bauby was, so here's the following. His case closely 
resembles mine in the beginning. Knowing who he was may help others know 
who I am.

Jean-Dominique Bauby (French: 23 April 1952 – 9 March 1997) was a 
well-known French journalist, author and editor of the French fashion 
magazine ELLE.

On 8 December 1995 at the age of 43, Bauby suffered a massive stroke. When 
he woke up twenty days later, he found he was entirely speechless; he could 
only blink his left eyelid. Called locked-in syndrome, this is a condition 
wherein the mental faculties remain intact but most of the body is 
paralyzed. In Bauby's case his mouth, arms, and legs were paralyzed,Despite 
his condition, he wrote the book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by 
blinking when the correct letter was reached by a person slowly reciting 
the alphabet over and over again using a system called partner assisted 
scanning. Bauby composed and edited the book entirely in his head, and 
dictated it one letter at a time. (This came from Wikipedia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Dominique_Bauby as we don't need 
specifics. Do use a couple resources if looking for something very 
important.)



It was the same eye for me. I say "when I opened my eyes", but rly it was 
only 1 eye. The movie is the same title as his book. The movie has 
subtitles. U can prolly rent it. I saw it on cable.﻿nonono200: @PAGATY what's wrong with it being in french? if you just turn the 
subtitles on then it's perfectly simple to understand what's going on.vjrei: It is called love of the best kind. folladordeprostis: emmanuelle seigner is a hot MILFSxnz: Appreciate absolutely everything, even your body, maybe even so far to 
appreciate your own mind and its thought, and your feelings... how far can 
you go? If every single thing is appreciate, where do YOU stand? Who is the 
appreciator?Epsilonic: @FilthyReech Your Hand In Mine by Explosions In The Sky. You should

modern science we have now-a-days he was revived but the damage was already 
done and he was paralyzed in his entire body except for his eyes, but only 
the left could blink, and the other could not so they had to sew that one 
shut. He wrote the entire book "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" by 
blinking his left eye when a nurse would say a letter. He passed away about 
a week after the book was published, wonderful bookEminentKnight: Anyone who liked this movie will like Into the Wild. Similar kind of 
allegorical tale. stillvill24: this is where i learned about explosions in the sky <3SamanthaDawson1: just ordered this, cant wait to see itChesterKhan: There is no such thing as a worthless life.

Igmar Bergman, Even Fellini. 这个电影给了我很深刻的印象。ahkim87: but in terms of who is the greater filmmaker, it's bergman. but i don't 
think on these terms when it comes to both these directors. there is little 
use to even compare filmmakers in this calibur anyway. iBoYube: so funny cute little boy 0:21 lolluksm77: I love Bergman, but I always feel like it's kind of preachy. Like he's 
giving a lecture about his point of view in life. Not really in a 
self-righteous, arrogant way, but still... This film has the same style of 
Bergman, but let's you take your own conclusions. It doesn't hand you down 
a certain belief to oblige... ahkim87: too different from french new wave or fellini...but better than bergman? i 
don't know about that, but it's up there in my book with him

a fair and dignified memorial for the brave defenders and the vainness of 
their heroism. On the other hand you should not forget that especially the 
japanese army was probably the most inhuman and brutal one in WWII.﻿Spinnes: One of the best Clint Eastwood movie﻿Philip Nilsson: The russians during WW2 were 10 times worse than japan with wasting 
soldiers. At stalingrad the russians sended in everything they could to 
stop the germans and i mean soldiers running towards fortafications, cannon 
fire, machineguns, tanks, german soldiers, fire, mines, gas. ﻿Jacob Clausen: great war lot of life lost R.I.P﻿Cybermat47: One of the few movies that's as good as Das Boot. I can't wait to see Flags

maybe Chemical or Biological. Whatever. The entire planet suffers a mass 
extinction, and mining teams in Hazmat suits mine the unobtanium. Done. Too 
expensive? Well Unobtanium happens to sell for 20 million a kilo and they 
have it all. Yay. Go Humans!﻿Faridl manzarek: suck movie﻿Murilo Melo: i can't believe 4 years have passed!﻿Tariqslo: It proves more money doesn't necessarily make a good movie :(﻿sayenshin: Look people, you can deny for all you want, but the facts don't lie. Over 
2.7 BILLIONS made at the box office means a great load of people loved the 
movie! I'm sorry it didn't have that ''Avatar'' feeling on you, but I've 
experienced it and it was amazing! I didn't have any expectations 
whatsoever and I think it paid a lot.

The plot is not that complicated, but the detailed world and the dynamic of 
the movie was incredible. Not once did I noticed the computer generated 
animations that were the Navi's, maybe because I suspended my disbelief for 
three hours.

I really don't understand some critics saying the story lacked complexity 
while critics are covering with gold the ''Gravity'' movie which has less 
story developpment. It's like a hero, some people like to bring him down. 
''Avatar'' was exceptionnal, period.﻿DredWolfster: A very entertaining movie.

It marked a turning point in the year 2009, when we had finally kicked out 
Bush Jr, and sworn in Obama. Dubya and Cheney left the political scene with 
their hotly opposed wars and subsequent major economic collapse, this movie 
makes a nice response to the obscene orgy of war violence aka The War On 
Terror and it's darkness that gripped the world's attention for the better 
part of the 2000s...﻿Klára Hedánková: I just love it!﻿Shubham Patel: In the history of Hollywood movies, one of the best and costly movie is

hyped up 3D thing, so I had negative associations with this movie. Just 
came across this trailer and now it's high on my list. Might try and watch 
it this weekend.﻿drekson23: I love this trailer but when I saw the complete movie it wasn't that 
amazing.1983Jacko: Not today, but this type of story has been done so many times. It's nothing

that movie studios are to scared to put money into something new so they
