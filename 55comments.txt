Very funny film😋﻿
after this trailer not need anymore to watch it :)﻿
Just watched this.  Pure class. Fookin Brill. ﻿
first 37 min are boring as shit. if not aliens this movie would be one of 
the most boring ones i have ever seen. anyway at least they showed a 
realistic scenario of what would happen if we lost technology. ﻿
Tonight's movie?﻿
DOES ANYONE know the name of the song that plays at the beginning of 
"Completing the Golden Mile" Part 1 on the blu-ray???﻿
Definitely worth your time. Not life-changing, but thouroughly 
entertaining. Bit tragic, bit drama, did not expect that. 8.5/10﻿
Whats the song called﻿
dAT SONG DOE﻿
i jerked off to this but i didnt like it﻿
music names plsssss ﻿
little too close for comfort as I plan to meet the scooby gang this weekend 
in Leicester﻿
Can believe not so many people know this movie﻿
WISH I could find someone who loves this film as much as I do!!!!﻿
i like this movie so funny i just finished watching it on (oozigoo.weebly 
com) it is HD and free﻿
Check out "The World's End"official trailer from the below link. Its a 
great movie to watch. ﻿
I want to see this﻿
the trailers are good, but the actual film was bad﻿
Excellent indictment of liberalism as a mental disorder.  Simon is a 
libertarian, his pals are mostly conservative, sharing many but not all of 
his views, and while they all have their own problems, they are 
individuals.  Everyone else, almost, in that town is a hive-mind blank, 
beings incapable of having thoughts that stray from a specific belief.  
Now, you can say that also applies to conservatism, and sometimes it does, 
but we have much more to fear now from the 1984-esque vision that 
progressives are working towards.  "Everyone will be mediocre and have an 
adequate life."  I especially liked how the robot blood was blue, like a 
blue state.  Granted, this is a British movie, but we have almost 5 times 
as many potential movie viewers here in the US, so the director knew how to 
get a message across to a larger audience.  I also liked how Simon's 
character thought there'd be so much more after graduation and it was all a 
big lie, which is largely due to progressive policies in western 
countries.  Too much government, not enough freedom. ﻿
Love this film! I am watching it again! ( already did but only like 24 
minutes through... This is funny. But it didn't make me laugh Really OUT 
loud though but hey... The comedy didn't lack. I still find some things in 
memory. Like when that guy didn't want a beer at the first bar they went 
too and he drank water instead. And King jerry ( I think that's his name ) 
was like...wwwwhhhAAAT? And later he said..."I don't believe this 
...something something...drink F**KING RAIN ! Ha ha !﻿
Again a terrible British Film of the world being taken over by robots not 
zombies *sigh* no creativity and stupid British humour !!!﻿
Simon Ross The Bourne Ultimatum :)﻿
Doomsday By Nero
yeah.. im a big fan of pegg.. paul was better then this and it wasnt even 
part of the trilogy.. Shaun of the dead was a masterpiece, Hot Fuzz was 
gold... this move only made me laugh out loud twice. This was a bad way to 
end a trilogy that was founded on 1 simple yet main aspect. Nick was the 
goof and Pegg was the lead... yet in this they almost make you not like 
peggs character by making him a twat and making nick the more composed 
serious character... it was a bad move... makes me sad
my problem with this movie is they attempt to drink 12 pints and they only 
take one piss.
$$$$
Just got done watching this.. 

Pretty good movie to watch, especially for people in relationships.. ﻿
This looks so boring.﻿
POSSIBLE SPOILER: I haven't watched the film, but I'm going to take a wild 
guess and say Anna Kendrick's baby daddy is actually Olivia Wilde's 
bf/exbf. And then the couples do a switcheroo at the end and live happily 
ever after.﻿
The only joy I received from watching this film was to see Olivia Wilde 
walking around with her miraculous beauty. I do not recommend this film to 
anyone as it was utter horseshit. ﻿
i really liked the movie, it's just a chill realistic-type movie with not 
much other aim than to show how life and love goes. don't watch it if 
you're expecting huge twists and turns or lots of drama or some crap like 
that. and everyone can stop with their predictions, it's not the typical 
ending, it's supposed to be an indie film, what do you expect.﻿
I think it looks good. If you're not into chill, indie flicks no, this 
wouldn't be your thing.  ﻿
I really loved this film. Very enjoyable, Olivia Wilde is perfect.﻿
I think people how really enjoy big block buster movies won't really enjoy 
this movie. It's a good movie to the type of people who like a simple light 
hearted movie, that is equivalent to someone telling you a story of 
"their's"﻿
Reeally liked this movie﻿
So predictive. Bland and a lil bit weird.﻿
Looks boring﻿
NIPPLE﻿
what were the two or three songs that were featured in this trailer !?!﻿
Good movie!﻿
i hope the scary movie sequel includes a parody of this movie because it 
sucks so badly! But wait, the last Scary Movie also kinda sucks....so....﻿
it looks like it's going to be totally predictable, and yet i really want 
to watch it. it's got jake johnson, anna kendrick, olivia wilde, and beer. 
it speaks to me.﻿
well i just watched this movie. is it just me or does every scene feel 
awkward? like i dunno....﻿
Awesome movie, every character seem like someone I know. ﻿
the movie might have gotten a couple of overly romantic and deep thinkers 
thinking .. other than that yeah it was a crap shoot not gonna lieeee. only 
message i got from it: having sex is definitely cheating but the borderline 
flirty stuff yeah thats okay. ... dont watch it. read the bible. Amen.﻿
What's up with the trailers nowadays? It's like they show the whole movie 
here....﻿
I have seen and noob. No beginning no end, story is 0 zero end is nothing. 
Booring film hurrible. Why didnt comes toghether the real 2 lover? So now 
the 2 par didnt pass toghether. The girls comes home from the Summer 
weekend, and where from the Bahamas or the tree house. LOL Why didnt makes 
better films?﻿
as if i need more reasons to drink on a daily basis﻿
Don't watch it. Its a pretty good film. But in the end, you realize that 
you've just wasted your time. ﻿
Opening in Williamsburg soon for jack wad hipsters to go see﻿
Loved the trailer, hated the movie.﻿
$$$$
I like the part when Emma say "I'm not fucking around" it was completely 
unexpected, I never thought she'd say anything like that. ﻿
They all die. Now do yourself a favour and don't watch it. It's 
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Please be This is the end 2!!!!﻿
This has to be the worst movie I have watched this year, it is just 
terrible. In fact I could not bring my self to see it to the end... too 
painful!﻿
Too much mess,too much stupidity, not at all funny. watch scary movie 
instead﻿
I swear, this movie is just as bad as The World's End. Project X, Movie 43, 
The Bourne Legacy, That's My Boy, White House Down and horror movies! They 
all suck! Final Fantasy XII: Advent Children, Bionicle movies, Naruto 
movies, Bleach movies and Evangelion movies all the way! ﻿
OMG this movie sucks, i didn't even get to the half of it. How it's a 
comedy movie and has tragic in it. I swear no other comedy movie will ever 
top Project X PERIOD!!!!﻿
HERMIONE!!!﻿
Whats with these retarded movies everyone seems to go to?!!? is everyone 
retarded?!!?!? I'm so sick of these college themed idiotic movies, someone 
needs a reality check...﻿
I liked superbad and loved pineapple express would i like this movie? lol 
I mean those movies were retarded but they were funny in a stupid way.
But not pathetically retarded like the scary movie series...﻿
Looks awesome! better go watch it. ﻿
I can't believe some people don't like this movie.. I mean I get that 
everyone has a diff sense of humor but come on, this movie was fucking 
hilarious. It's rare that a movie has me laughing throughout the entire 
thing. Def worth the watch. ﻿
1:54  emma watson?﻿
"The Lakers could've just won"

15. LA Lakers 20 39 .339 ﻿
The Nutella. That's all you need.﻿
I don't know what is wrong in Spain with these movies. All of them were 
retitled with stupid names, making them seems like a bad teen (un)funny 
movie.
This was retitled as: "Party to the end" (in Spanish, of course).
Superbad was retitled as: "Superhorny/randy"
Pineapple Express was retitled as: "Superstoned"﻿
Is Rihanna in it?﻿
how is this movie bad. you all must be mentally challenged﻿
0:29 loool
it was a joy to watch! haha!
THIS MOVIE IS FUKIN AWSJOME!!
*patrick stewart impression* you thought that was real? ACTING!!
This movie is so fucking funny, the ending killed me! So great!
What a waste of time this is...
Only the dopest movie Iv ever seen since Furious 6!!
$$$$
Nice :D﻿
he went from Scarlett to an old bag D: lol﻿
The biggest crap all time.﻿
amaze this movie remind so much someone that i know...  ﻿
Almost every guy that knows how to use a computer between the ages of 18-30 
can relate to this movie. I found out that I seen most of the porno clips 
in this movie lmao. ﻿
This movie was so damn good and realistic﻿
after watching this movie, I felt sexuality attracted to Julianne Moore ﻿
This movie is amazing just amazing, Goto go and watch my porn lol﻿
I saw this trailer while trying to watch porn.﻿
Dat ass scarlett johansson has jesus almighty﻿
Well he was right about them giving awards for porn at least. They should 
too. After all, porn stars work way harder (or are worked way harder) than 
some of the actors﻿
Loved it. Simple, to the point, good topic, good acting, a big exaggerated, 
but it was there to prove a point. Good effort. 8 from me.﻿
Message of this story (in a nut shell), Men - Woman are more then just a 
"play thing"! Woman - Men are more then just your "slave"!﻿
I'm gonna live this life﻿
"They give awards for porn, too."﻿
Anyone know the name of the song in the beginning of this trailer??﻿
loved this movie .. funny  in my opinion ...  ﻿
Funny how i've watched every porn video that was in this movie﻿
Great movie! Gordon-Levitt did a great job portraying a Jersey shallow not 
so bright douchebag!! He was very believable! Johansson  and Moore were 
also great with their barbie doll and disturbed wise older woman roles 
(respectively) I started liking it more towards the end (which I will not 
disclose for those who have not watched it) By the way, I also found the 
movie hilarious!﻿
Decent performances, but hated the movie. It was kind of boring overall.﻿
This movie has great soundtracks and musical scores.﻿
/r/PornFree﻿
I loved this movie. Great acting, simple and clean storyline and the issue 
at hand couldn't be more relevant. ﻿
Conclude the trailer with Mark Wahlberg... definitely need to see the movie 
now.﻿
Girls can be addicted to porn to﻿
$$$$
I just tried to watch this Movie with a Buddy of mine, We loved Talladega 
Nights, Step Brothers, The Goods ect.  This Movie was just Moronically 
Stupid, I mean BAAD.
I think The Director must have Been Smoking Crack with the Toronto Mayor 
Rob Ford.
At least now I figured out what all the "Make $300 a Day "emails are 
about...writing good reviews about "Anchorman 2" ?﻿
Can not believe that I paid 20 bucks for a copy of this movie! And I tried 
to take it back to wal mart and the lady asked why I wanted to return it 
and I told her because it sucked! And she said that wasn't an acceptable 
reason to return the movie. So I left it laying on the counter and walked 
away! It sucked so badly that I didn't even want to take it back home with 
me! The "I don't like your face...do something about your face" joke that 
they used from step brothers was pretty gay and the part where Ron is 
blind...was a bit too much like the seen where Ricky Bobby in Talladega 
nights cant walk.  Anchorman 1 was pretty dam funny and so was Step 
brothers but fuck me I didn't want to see em make a part two to Step 
brothers and  Anchorman 1 and make it the same fucking movie!  If you see 
this movie for sale and its not in the  bargain bin marked down to $5.99 
then don't bother buying it unless you just enjoy wasting money!﻿
Wow, this was pathetically unfunny, and Steve Carell was the Jar-Jar Binks 
of this movie.﻿
I SAW THIS MOVIE THE DAY IT CAME OUT AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY I MAKE BETTER 
VIDEOS ON MY YOUTUBE CHANNEL﻿
I cannot believe there is no single decent copy of this movie online yet :(﻿
Most random film seen in a while! Hilarious!﻿
i STARTED WATCHING THIS MOVE and couldnt turn it off.....

very funny ﻿
What a gawd awefull movie, didnt laugh oine single time, same lame jokes 
from the first one, what Garbage, if you think this is funny your 9yrs old 
lol﻿
this movie is funny but like my other buddy over here said, some parts are 
like 'move on' and some parts are like ROFL...like the part where Ron get 
hit in his stomach and cries like..."mama, you baby got hurt"....and the 
sounds he make...and Brick and Chani's part...totally a fun movie with some 
boring stuff...but who cares unless we had something better...﻿
The dinner scene & the end fight scene are absolutely piss funny. Some 
parts I was thinking ok move on because it was hard to watch but all in all 
it was good fun movie.﻿
This movie felt like a chore to watch it was so bad.﻿

I watched it. It was an unfunny piece of shit and it makes the first one 
look like a masterpiece.﻿
Well finally Will Smith have a good movie that he is on too bad it is only 
a cameo.﻿
Fuck that was a good movie xD definitely recommended!﻿
I strongly dislike the 3 guys that are not will farrel. and I think farrell 
is only ever good when mark wahlberg is around.﻿
I thought this was a decent movie up until the last 20 minutes. It should 
have just been Burgundy vs. Lime but shameless cameos and a dragged out 
fight made this movie pretty stupid and over the top. There were funny 
moment's throughout the film but the end just kind of took that away from 
you and disappointed you.. I felt like I was 7 years old in the last 20 
minutes I mean I can laugh at stupidness but not over the top stupidness.﻿
I love this movie it's funny﻿
worst movie, anchorman 1 was funnier :P﻿
Brick you're not dead. I'm alive. Yes. I'm alive!
you have a dirty horrish mouth.
Looks great lol
Have you seen the previews.
not funny 
Love Brick

If you guys all saw the movie, what are you doing on Youtube watching the 
trailer? Seriously. Literally everyone in the comments below me have seen 
it. There's no point in watching the trailer, no?

But it looks pretty good, will rent it someday.﻿
Super funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
Lol it's a big black penis!!!﻿
Lol, this movie was freaking hilarious ﻿
One of my top three favorite comedies. I'm also in love with Get Him To The 
Greek and Bad Teacher. ﻿
Seem's like they can't make a movie today without a ''dick'' scene!. Funny 
movie but sometime's they go to far ..
go fuck yourself little cunt
who pays for a movie when there is a bay full of gentle pirates? :P 
I bet you went to yify and saw this movie on the popular page. Then you 
opened a new tab to watch the movie's trailer on YouTube, thinking whether 
you're going to download it or not.

Oh I wanna see this movie I'm so excited ﻿
so disturbing﻿
he`s hot...﻿
zombies are not supposed to be cute..﻿
Absolutely better than Twilight IMO﻿
what happened at the end?﻿
just watched this movie yesterday ;) i cried of pure happyness ﻿
As stupid as this movie seemed at times, it was still good. As long as you 
can manage to take everything you've learned about zombies from other 
movies and toss it out the window. Very clever and different film. Laughed 
a few times as well, I recommend it.﻿
the movie was Amazing !!!!!!!!!
 nicholas hoult  did a great job even as a zombie he's still hot!﻿
2 Corinthians 4:3-4

3 But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are 
perishing, 

4 whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the 
light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should 
shine on them.﻿
i had fun watching this at cinema..hehe... funny stuff.﻿
This really looks good! Going to watch!﻿
10/10 all day everyday. I thought that I wont see anything new in this 
genre and bam - there it is. A lovely story, charming and funny, absolutely 
fresh. The only tragedy with this movie is that when people hear "zombie in 
love" they change the channel - and they shouldn't!!!! That movie is great!﻿
I was gonna chop this one up and dismiss it with "another usual zombie 
movie, as if we don't have enough of them already" rating.  Now I'd like to 
see the movie, and I hope it's as funny as this trailer. NO SPOILERS, 
PLEASE.﻿

IS THAT TONY STONEM??﻿
.. I like this
WATCH IT NOW: va4movie.com
I viewed it the other day on the web already! Do not believe me? I don't 
care. I took an entire afternoon to search the Internet and found this 
website where they safely stream movies on-line 100 percent free. They have 
all of the hottest hits, including this one. Here is the web-site link to 
discover more about it... WatchTheseMovies.co­­m

It's very ronantic

NICHOLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAS

i really dnt know why this movie got such high ratings. It was just a 
simple quirky movie.﻿
If you're someone who dislikes this movie, then...well...you and I can 
never be friends.




That'll show em!﻿
Back in my day, Bill Murray made comedies. GOOD comedies mind you﻿
Great American true movie! Get a chance watch it sit back and enjoy! ﻿
Am I the only one who finds this movie incredibly romantic? Everyone else 
can watch The Notebook and Dear John, I'll be drooling over Sam and Suzy. 
:)﻿
I bet you enjoy the films of Wes Anderson.﻿
haha, omg- i have to see this movie﻿
that movie should be banned so inappropriate. ﻿
I didnt like this﻿
Best movie I've ever seen﻿
They used music from pride and prejudice﻿
This movie is weird, really weird. But I love it !!﻿
Favorite movie. Sadly, its not on Netflix anymore. :'(﻿
Hey it's Damien from the Omen. ﻿
Love this movie so much,,﻿
This my favourite movie ever﻿
Pretentious and overrated art house garbage.﻿
Oh! How I wish I can live in Wes Anderson's movie.﻿
scout sucks﻿
music in 1:27 please?﻿
Huesito﻿
does anyone know the song at 0:48?﻿
@daniel kennedy  why did you come back two weeks after your first comment 
to say the same thing? guess what. you do sound like a pervert. not to 
sound like an asshole or anything.﻿
I only need one word to describe this movie: fun.﻿
Without a doubt, Moonrise Kingdom deserved the Best Original Screenplay 
oscar over Django Unchained.﻿
$$$$
The guy is way to old for her.﻿
I didn't understand this movie :(﻿
I wish I could find my own Tiffany. She's like the perfect girl, guess 
that's why it's called a movie...﻿
it is better than i expected :) i love this movie!﻿
Definitely not an Eagles fan but just watched this movie for the first time 
and it's great!﻿
I love Tiffany﻿
This is the movie that everyone was talking about? Really? Even the trailer 
is terrible. ﻿
10/10﻿
"She is my friend with an 'f'"
"Capital F"
"...for friend"﻿
Hes just like "Ah, What the HELL??!!??" XDXDXDXDXD﻿
I feel like they based the old grumpy guy in Up on Robert De Niro..﻿
best movie I've ever seen, not even exaggerating. ﻿
This movie was soooo different from the book﻿
OMG ITS JENNIFER LAWRENCE!!!!!!﻿
the whole movies and great but the ending scene made me burst into tears 
right before the credits " the beautiful song in the credits made my 
emotions just stuck on reply" i wish it doesnt just cut out from there :C 
best movie i watched ﻿
o and if you have not watch it and want to you can watch it of megashare 
for free﻿
It was 8 months, not 4 years.﻿

whole damn time.

badass movie Can´t wait for 22 jump street!!! ﻿
*brad*﻿
Prepare yours asses bitches for Jump 22 Street¡﻿
best movie﻿
this movie is the best!!﻿
I love this movie, could watch it twice in a row, and I have. But one thing 
that gets me is when people say Bead looks like he's a 40 year old, he 
looks like he's in high school. There's freshman in my HS who have legit 
beards and shadows, they look 40.﻿
I want Watch the 22 NOW¡ XD come in june ﻿
I just noticed that guy from project x is in this movie . ﻿
I'm Eric's bitch.﻿
About to watch this. :D﻿
Lol when did I get stabbed ﻿
Shit! Can't wait for 22 jump street﻿
Funniest movie ever and also has a very smart script﻿
The Funniest part is when Mr.Walters gets shot in the dick﻿
22 is under away﻿
soo funny﻿
I have no strong feelings for this movie one way or the other. ﻿
When I first saw trailers for this movie I initially wasn't that interested 
and thought it was gonna be a major flop and embarrassingly bad movie. 
Thank God for my sister's interest in Channing Tatum, when we and another 
friend of mine went to see this, we actually really enjoyed it and it 
became a favorite of ours. Didn't expect that at all. In fact, my friend 
and I still quote this movie on a regular basis. ﻿
Lol the censored parts sound dumb but this movie was hilarious!﻿
Haha, makes me laugh all the time﻿
Lol﻿
awesome movie ,, super comedy movie all must see this movie ,, iam waiting 
for part 2﻿

1 thing i wonder about this movie, why the hell do they still the rocket to 
launch the Arc-net into the space when they have tons of alien at their 
place?﻿
They changed quite a few moments in the movie compared to this trailer.﻿
Just watched it. WAAAY better than MIB2. Man that one blew﻿
I just watched MIB3 Good movie!! ﻿
I didn't see wen will Smith was talking 2 the drawing guy on the wall﻿
Am I the only one who noticed a HUGE hole in the plot? If K was killed in 
1969, he would not have been alive to recruit J. So how does J still have a 
job after K is killed???﻿
Órale! Men In Black 3!﻿
Ha! The MEN IN BLACK... are back! First trailer for #MIB3:﻿

There's going to be a third Men in Black movie apparently.﻿

Saw MIBIII Yesterday In 3D! It Is A Must Go See!﻿
Remember when SoHo gave Will Smith a bunch of shit about his trailer? 
http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/will_arious_last_laugh_tw_smith_6IPr2tuaWFlUdCJf4eYWyM

He should walk into the Mayors office with a copy of this MIB3 trailer, say 
"Suck it Bitches!" and then walk out.﻿
:D﻿
yeah﻿
This should be fun! Men in Black 3!﻿
So there will be a MEN IN BLACK 3 coming in the summer next year.﻿

Yet another jew made perverted, base and low class piece of shit movie that

Was sooo disappointed in this movie! Oh my gosh I've never heard so much 
swearing in my life, the jokes are crass and low. America disappoints 
again! There is such a thing as humor that isn't just swearing and crude 
jokes!﻿
This movie is pretty boring, the acting was bad, speacially Leslie Mann´s﻿

I hope they continue the series now that they've revived it with Reunion; 
those American Pie spinoffs were quite horrid, especially Book of Love, 
that move was soo bad except for a few scenes which I liked.
I hope they make a movie with all the stiflers :/
stiffler never gets old
American Pie has many sentimental value to me!
This was better than Citizen Kane

kristen wigg was the greatest thing about this movie i don't know what you

I think if Melissa was not in this movie, it would have bombed in the box 
office. She was the one who brought the house down. One hell of a funny 
lady.
@TheEngineerMaldita IT IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! I swear you will poop

good...cant also believe they put dis movie up for an oscar..r u kidding 
me?!
who clicked on this for 'fat amy' 
@CrazedPeeling FUCK YOU
Best movie!!!
So .. I guess that's the whole movie ..
Really first comedy i laughed to from a veery long time. Big recommend!
$$$$
Watched this film recently. It's an independent film, a 
fish-out-of-water/mismatched-buddies comedy set in the US Midwest. The main 
characters are so well played (the actor John C. Reily steals every scene 
he's in!) that they easily drew me into their wacky adventure. I really 
enjoyed the film. I must admit that I also felt nostalgic since I lived in 
Cedar Rapids...﻿
Well, this is a peculiar comedy that you don't see very often. Though I 
didn't lol, I find myself smiling and giggling most of the time. I guess 
this is one of those light-hearted film that makes you feel good. 

You should check it out.﻿
"I just made love to a woman. She's not that pretty and her mouth tastes 
like cigarettes"﻿
Hvis du ikke har set Ed Helms("The Hang Over", "The Daily Show") og John C. 
Reilly("Step Brothers", "Magnolia") i Cedar Rapids endnu, så kan den 
absolut anbefales. Hvem skulle tro forsikringsagenter havde det så sjovt? 
:-)
(Jeg ved så bedre....)
Cedar Rapids Movie Trailer Official (HD)
Ude på Apple TV - US nu.﻿
I watched Cedar Rapids tonight (with Ed Helms, John C. Reilly) and it was a 
very pleasant surprise. It had some great side characters which for some 
reason make a comedy for me. You get some great vulgarity from Reilly and 
somewhat of a real plot.﻿
﻿
﻿
How can he help it? There's a demon in him. ;)
son I get two bags of peanuts every time I fly #thatshitcray
I loledhearing about this. A movie near me! :D
Dramah/ comedy?
@kiddem17 I think it's a subtler Hangover. Which is better in some people's 
opinions.
Oh my! When did Cedar Rapids get all those skyscrapers? 
I liked this movie but I doubt many are going to feel the same way. This 
film is much more niche, targeted a very specific audience. I'm glad I saw 
the movie before seeing this trailer though. Alot of the movie is basically 
summed up in this trailer (not going to lie).
Love Ed Helms! :')
did this movie fail in the theaters? i wanted to see this but i never saw 
it in the theaters!
I do a pretty convincing Omar from the HBO program, The Wire.
@Promotionpage Where captain kirk is from !
NTS... not too shabby.
im about to watch this...nice
Most of these comments are fake fucked up shit. Is it worth watching?
No problem. I'm sure CR will look a bit different in a year. They seem to 
be fixing it up pretty nicely since the flood. It looks a lot cleaner. I 
will definitely be in Australia sometime. A lot of my idols are from there. 
Looks like a fun place to visit.
u can see glimpses of hangover in this movie :O
@MrDatonedude I lived by Kenwood School for 20 years. 
The trailer is good, but the movie is horrible, Bad , and it's suck. :|
$$$$
My sister told me we need to see this film (we have a brother).  She is 
right.﻿
I just watched this movie, this is what I call a happy-see, happy-go, 
happy-end movie; it just doesn't get you fucking depressed and sort of 
alleviates you of the shits that happen to us; Ned ain't stupid in the 
movie, but pretty much gullible (probably as much as I am); nice movie, 
quite light on the humour but equally on the content. A movie you can spend 
your time on, :).﻿
really nice movie...makes you feel good....more people should be like 
ned....﻿
OMG that part when he smashed that kids fingers in the door is GOLD LMFAO﻿
Thanks to netflix I had the priviledge to watch this beautiful movie! ﻿
i love my dog﻿
Very.....nice﻿
Watching this movie give me dezavu﻿
"You know what, you know what?"

"Wow."﻿
And also Rashida Jones.﻿
I passed this movie up but it turned out to be so sweet & funny! I kid you 
not, but you must cry happy at the end!! 
bice brate uskoro nebrini
I really liked this movie. Paul Rudd gives a great performance (and sort of 
looks like a very hot Grizzly Adams).
What is the name of the song thats playing at the end? 
Watching Random Trailers:)))

He is Jesus.

@ezrik55 Hell yeah!
Is it just me or has new videos always, 301-302 views?
WTF? the comercial to this trailer.. was the trailer to this movie.... so i 
was watching it.. and wondering why it said.. skip this ad now. LOL so i 
clicked it and it was the exact same video LOL
@Chazz8Zelda ?????? They clearly show that it is Danny McBride
@Chazz8zelda it's Danny McBride
what is that for a song ?
Fucking BB guns! That is so hilarious! They could have bought the rifles 
and shotguns in Walmart. But this one totally blew my mind.LOL I paint bb 
guns all the time.
gotta watch it...seems great :)
FPSRUSSIA!
THIS LOOKS PRETTY GOOD!
@Chazz8Zelda actually its dany McBride, they say that directly in the 
trailer
danny mcbride in gorilla mask yuss 
looks like it could of had potential 
Cuz the cops will shoot us in our face~
@Chazz8Zelda its danny mcbride and nick swardson in the masks, wtf are you 
talking about
hey thats monkey from bruno mars lazy song>? :D
im fucking sold on this movie
@MrObscureReference Doesn't seem to much like "tough luck" for me. He 
probably just wanted to do something which wasn't too serious.
I think it's monstorous that they took an actual tragic true story about a 
poor man who died this exact same way not too long ago, and made a comedy 
film for us all to laugh like it's funny or something. This man DIED. I 
also, think it's even more monstorous that I'll be watching this movie and 
laughing my ass off cuz I just don't give a fuck.lol XD
I wasnt gonna watch this until I saw Jesse Eisenburgs name
0:52 Lazy Song anyone? Also,I love Jesse Eisenburg
@syc1988 it is the same guy
$$$$
Shane brought me here. And it looks like a very very good movie. So I'm 
gonna watch it :')﻿
F**K CANCER!!﻿
Bruce Willis﻿
I really enjoyed this movie, going through the whole hospital thing myself 
since a while and things were so regonizable that it became a little scary 
haha. It made me feel a bit better cause it was clear that i wasn't the 
only person going through all these sometimes absurd things. There were 
moments that i had a break down during the movie cause it showed exactly 
how i felt at those moments. There were also moments that i couldn't stop 
laughing. Really a brilliant movie and a must see for people who go through 
it theirselfs and there family and friends, even though it can be a little 
confrontating sometimes.﻿
Great movie, I'd recommend it.﻿
I really liked this movie. ﻿
 movie turns out to be the best and the one and only kind of its.what a 
move,not even a single person in the world dislike it.if there is one i 
don't give a f..k﻿
seth rogen + joseph gordon levvit gotta be a decent movie ﻿
omg!I can not stop crying throughout the course of the film..certainly from 
the most perfect movies ι've seen!!
omg he is so hot :\ 
when you watch the movie you'll wind it even better than the trailer
okies CHILL-If you remember I said it was a GOOD movie. For heaven's sake 
CHILL!
No he isn't... he is that Jesus looking mother fucker who made out with his 
girlfriend. AKA exhibit whore.

well, to him maybe it's a 10/10.;)
knowing a cousin that went through chemo the small things bother me like 
him losing his hair roots but not his eyebrows and eyelashes but still.. 
good movie for 99% of viewers
WHAT A MOVIE !!!!!!!!!!
interesting movie 
just watched this
Just finished. Me, too. JGL is amazing. AMAZING. 
my favorite movie.. made me shed some tears. 
Well its based on a TRUE story. So in order for JGL to die that wld require 
the real person to die too. And changing it from the original wld defeat 
the whole purpose.
nope me to
He RECYCLES!!! Theres NO way he can have cancer!!! -_-
looking at Joseph Gordon-Levit and the tittle 50/50, the biggest part of my

Jason, i love you !﻿

Unbelievable movie. Gleeson is one of the greatest actors alive. ﻿
Trailer surprisingly makes it look not that good, but man this movie is 
freaking great. I love it, so many good scenes. Similar to In Bruges﻿
'Fear Gorm' is blue man, the proper translation is 'fear dubh' for black 
man.﻿
Great movie and great to hear a bit of Irish in it too.
Good Point Maria Chamney I picked that up myself. Clubbythe i always 
thought that An Diabhal was the Irish for The Devil. Well that's what we 
call the Devil in East Mayo anyway. But I know it maybe different in other 
parts of the country.﻿
In Brugge was shite. Ralph Fiennes' cockney accent was the worst thing I've 
ever heard. Fuck that shite! ﻿
I love Irish people!!!!!!!!!! 
Great comedy!!﻿
I only have a few words: great actor. He can perform any role in any film﻿
This is actually a very good movie﻿
Loved this movie.﻿
Did you?
Jesus you even think like the idiots in this film.
Dude this is comedy, where boarders do not exist if u like it good 4 u, if 
not keep ur mouth shut on this subject. In case u didn't notice it's DARK 
humour. 
Are you that blind? You didn't even justify why I talk much shit. At least 
I state why I think the movie is bad in the comment you replied to and 
describe it in more detail to the ones who asked why. Your comment is just 
"don't talk so much shit". You're even contradicting your self. How can my 
comment be "pointless" and "much shit" at the same time?
might as well say... if you're racist thumbs this up if its quoted it's 
mis-quoted btw
I can sleep easy now. Thanks for accepting my apology sir, and I don't get 
the "cigar incidents" reference. Sorry. I'll google it or something. 
American news is typically just American. Rarely is there anything from the 
UK televised here. Take care.
pun or something before killing the villian. this movie is art as it 
realistic and shows people what the wold is really like
This movie is hysterical. 
shut up 
Wait, at 1:19, did she not say that there was blue man at the door?
were*
Fear dubh means the devil, fear gorm is used for black man.
Well in the film he's only trying to be funny
That's a damn fine Irish name there Michael - good on ya son! And good on 
you for apologizing on behalf of America too. Though to be fair, its not 
your fault lad, Politicians (as here in the UK) have an awful lot to answer 
for though you'll seldom see one of those bastards offering an apology 
(unless its to their wife about "cigar incidents")
Don't talk so much shit.
I did get the jokes but they just weren't funny. Maybe it is funny to 
Americans or Irish people but it sucks for the rest of us. Most boring 
movie I've ever seen. I'll give that the part when he was scratching his 
balls to pull out a gun was original and funny but other than that it 
sucked.

HE SUCKS
Leslie Chao is a fuckin legend hahaha his laugh and everything LEGEND 
fuck all you niggas that don't like this movie!
indeed i do!
its soooo dam goooooood....specially the shemale part....liked the 
reactions of each one
name of the song at the begining .
Amusing at times, but incredibly rude and disturbing for the most part. 
Sorry to neglect the bandwagon but I think this is a bad influence on those 
who watch it, especially youngsters.
this movie was very funny 
Part 3 is on Los Angeles 
Yeah, this one was the same story as the first one. BUT WHO CARES?! I 
laughed SO hard to this movie and I love these characters. Can't wait for 
Part 3!!!!
 Today for the first time I saw the hangover.... the first one... Best 
movie I have ever seen!!
Whats the song at the begining
Love this movie purely because of Ed Helms' hissy fits. I love that guy
i wasn't sure whether or not to laugh and get a boner on the transgender 
prostitute part XD
If you guys want to watch this movie absolutely free of charge, you can on 
a website called shannospot(.) com. Everything is absolutely free of 
charge! Take care and God Bless
Hahahaha I like the scene when Alan tells what happen in Vegas
Raftery423 andJ4CKM2266 are in war lol;)

Hi I'm Paul﻿
paul smok ganja <3  me 2 I smoke ganja  . i m alien  ..﻿
ELO !﻿
Paul an alien escaped from Area 51 is rescued by two British geeks 
traveling across the Nevada deserts which I visit frequently. Aliens love 
the south western deserts because there are loads of tourist designations 
in Nevada and Southern California for aliens. Aliens and ghosts are big 
draws in both the Mojave and Great Basin deserts in Nevada and California. 
I am ready to party with Paul!﻿
[Movie] Paul (Good for 24hrs) DL, add me to your circles of Love, Enjoy!

Parece ser um filme interessante.﻿
watched this 7 times on the way 2 melbourne and 12 on the way back!!!!! 
best movie in the history of history﻿
After a few hours learning my new job I am ready to have a close encounter 
with a cool grey alien who drinks beer, smokes the best medical marijuana 
and a Marvin Gaye fan an alien that humans can party with unlike Alien, The 
Thing, The Predator﻿
PAUL rules﻿
If there was a film I could choose to watch with the girl it would be this 
one ... its fuken funny ive watched about 20 mins of it but was laughing so 
godamn hard nearly pissed my jeans at all the fucking jokes he makes is 
voice tones and expressions my little grey zeta alien called PAUL Paul 
(2011) - Official Trailer #2 [HD]﻿
The movie looks better than the trailer.. i mean it has to be
Nice and funny.
Its Roger from american dad
This could be paul senior with apostle paul being his 
junior...satyrpeterpagan
Who else here is excited about the world's end?
This movie could've been funnier if they kept Kristin Wiig out she ruined 
the whole thing
not going to eat a dead bird am i???
I love ELO so much!

Get off me you rapist! ;-)
This movie is pure propaganda, God is real, but He can't be found in a 
church, you have to search for Him in the wilderness, being born again. He 
created us, and He is quite capable of making Himself known. I personally 
testify that God, the Father of Jesus redeemed me and has given me new 
life, a life with Him, and not against Him in ignorance. Religeous people 
don't know Him either, He only has children, and they are few, but numbers 
will increase very soon.
Hey paul make more movies like that. Except with other aliens. Like leni 
lanapa, and in this system. Pleandiens for example.
No fences in this movie? 
This is the kind of Movie that you would never-ever get sick of.
if paul didnt have a deep voise, he would be rojer from american dad, paul 
also acts just like rojer.

His mother is dead you sick fuck.
That wasn't what you're Mother said ... when i fucked her 
Amazing movie!!!!
No. Get him to the Greek refers to a venue that Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) 
is scheduled to play at. The entire movie is them trying to get to that 
venue in time for the show. 
whooooo's that boy at 0:10 ?????
i just wanna know, does it have anything to do with Greeks.

Poker Face by Lady Gaga
they're exactly the same song... poker face by lady gaga
Okay seriosly - the trailer looks kinda fun ... is the movie any good? By 
high standards ...
*woop woop* Represent!! :D Lol
This is a good teenmovie. I have to disagree with the trailer though. In 
the beginning she was invincible. Anonymous she was through the entire 
movie, until the very end. She didn´t tell anyone how she truly was, it was 
all an act that everyone belived. Then she became popular amongst loads of 
guys and hated by many girls. Including her idiot hypocritical best friend. 
Oh, and the fuckin guy who was also her friend until he wanted to pay her 
for real sex and then got violent because she refused. 
Ermm Poker Face by Lady Gaga?

@LiCnDiCtrich he will be SO funny
I just watched this for the first time today, and it's kinda my new 
favorite movie. SO good! And super hilarious!! X)
Did they release the sex scene in this version? I read it was a big deal 
for them to release it in America
This is a classic Jim Carey role 
I saw this movie 6 months ago !!! FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!! EXCELLENT and I am 
not a big jim carrey fan but he did an excellent job! Oscar worthy
I love this line up I can not wait to see this movie. 
@thatoneguy937 Jim would give everything a sense
I love this little dog Ewan was holding. He looks funny with a small dog 
THANK YOU, JESUS.
Saw the movie - hilarious, cringeworthy at times & often poignant when you 
least expect it
I love the scene at 1:01 
I LOVE EWAN McGregor! Him and Jim Carey together should be good. 
It opened yesterday I am on my way to see it now 
Jim Carey is my favorite actor. 
Glad Ewan is back. Have not seen him in a while

I wish the 80's came back!!! This movie literally made me LOVE the 80's and 
I'm only 13
This is one of my favorite comedies and one of the few comedies I know of

was gonna suck.

born in 96 but this movie is so awesome
Watched this last night hilarious
Definitely, SuperBad. 
You can spot yolo on the map in the beggining.
This is actually the type of movie that you thought would suck big time 
when you watch it but actually the film that you didn't expect to love, 
praise and probably list it as one of your personal best comedy film of all 
time. This film just attacked and surprised me HARD and UNEXPECTED! I love 
the 80's (despite being born in 90's)
LOL!!! 1:11

Basically, this story is taken from a french movie, "le diner de cons"...﻿
Name of song at 1.51+ ?﻿

definitly better just sayin !

เนื่องจากสถานการณ์น้ำท่วมในขณะนี้จึงมีมติงดออกไปดูหนังตามโรงภาพยนตร์ 
เพราะเกรงว่าเมื่อออกมาแล้วจะต้องว่ายน้ำกลับบ้าน 
ดังนั้นควรอยู่กับเหย้าเอาไว้ แต่ว่าชีวิตไม่ขาดหนังเหลือบไปเห็น The Hangover 
เลยจัดมาดูแก้เครียด ซึ่งกำกับโดยพี่ท๊อด แต่ไม่ใช่ท๊อด ทองดีเขาคือ Todd 
Phillips เจ้าของผลงานที่ผมไม่เคยดูอย่าง Old School ในปี 2003 
ด้วยความที่หยิบมาดูไปพลางแบบไม่ได้คาดหวังอะไร เพราะหนังตลกฝรั่ง 
ผมเองไม่ค่อยจะฮาสักเท่าไหร่ และผิดหวังมากับหลายเรื่องทั้ง Scary Movie และ 
American Pie แต่กับเรื่องนี้กลับทำให้ไม่ง่วง แถมยังมีฮาในหลาย ๆ จังหวะ

เรื่องราวว่าด้วยสามหนุ่มเพื่อนกัน 
ที่พาเพื่อนว่าที่เจ้าบ่าวมาฉลองสละโสดที่ลาสเวกัส 
แต่กลับต้องมาเผชิญกรรมอย่างที่ในชีวิตเราคงไม่มีทางเกิดขึ้นได้ 
เมื่อตื่นเช้าขึ้นมาพวกเขากลับจำอะไรไม่ได้เลย แถมเจ้าบ่าวยังหายตัวไปซะงั้น 
ซ้ำร้ายยังต้องมาเจอเด็กทารกและ .... มาอยู่ในห้องพักแบบไม่รู้ที่มาที่ไป 
เรื่องวุ่น ๆ ทั้งหลายจึงเกิดขึ้นตามมา 
เมื่อสามเสือที่เหลือต้องออกไปช่วยกันสืบหาเพื่อพาเจ้าบ่าวกลับไปร่วมพิธีวิวาห์ให้ทัน﻿

@alterbyme yeah me too,like it totally showed that the english and the 
americans feel superior to every country in the world,except for france =)
This looks kinda like the trailer for "a clockwork orange".
Great movie,funny but on other side if you look deep its also excellent 
presentation of today politics scene all around world.How you fool news,ppl 
sacrifice politicians all in one.A smart,sophisticated comedy :)
The original trailer for Clockwork Orange was similar, lots of quick cuts 
set to the William Tell Overture.
KUNTA KINTAAAA!

"wars do sometimes work" haha I love that line and its delivery
one of the best trailers i've ever seen.
itty? itty isn't a word Bob. Love this movie!
I've bought it on DVD and still watch the trailer for the music!
Trailer = strangely reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove. Also, "It's like Bugsy 
Malone but with real guns."
@jamreaper Uh...Well.. That's like your opinion ,man.
great movie
Why is this on this channel? I thought this showed new trailers. I saw this

so fucking.. nope i cant i quit!﻿
Such a great film, still enjoy it every time I watch it﻿
It's a great film. Really realistic, and is something many people relate 
to ﻿
most underrated film. this is one of my favorite movies. ive watched it 
over & over & i didnt know why until i recently realized i never really 
understood the movie until now. the main message this film conveys is so 
stong. SOLITUDE. ﻿
this is just a perfect film I've seen it so many times hehe i know every 
line and every song, my gf doesn't understand why i love it so much, its 
I'm possible to describe but its just amazing﻿
Clooney should've won best actor for his performance ﻿
I just watched this.
It's a really beautiful little film with some outstanding *extras**.
The direction is great, and it has a great soundtrack :-)
Can't say anything bad about it at all.

Thanks to +blinkbox's Movie Mondays weekly promotion, I rented it for only 
99p (£0.99). I'm very happy about that :-)

*extras** : Clooney plays a guy hired by companies to fire their employees 
for them.
The employees are played by people who are either fantastic actors or were 
mined from *real* folk somehow.
They play their little tragedies very well indeed.﻿
@Axxrat well if what you're looking for in a movie is pointless nudity I 
understand that you were disappointed
your relationships are what makes your life worth living.
It's a great movie. It has elements of comedy and drama. Also, it goes 
through a period of time, that is probably relevant now or before, that is 
easy to relate too. Surprisingly, a well made movie 
Clooney doesn't do porno's my friend. I expected this to be better than it 
was, that's all. A 7.5/10 rating on the imdb suggested a good film. It was 
not so good. Both my wife and I found it slow and boring. As for the 
bedroom scene, I stand by what I said, highlight of the movie, which of 
course doesn't say much does it?
i dont like this kind of trailers were they brag about every magazine that 
wrote about their movie, anyways im going to watch it haha
i wish i've seen this before, the past 4 months i've been in an 
excruciating existential crisis. I questioned everything I thought to be 
true. And discovered now what this movie says to be true the slower we move 
the faster we die. moving is living. I hope people pay attention to this, I 
want to save them from the pain I went through. I'm grateful to have 
survived it mainly because I'm too afraid to kill myself. But when it's 
hurting really bad I thought I just might. But keep moving it matters
Nope, I prefer a good movie lol. Never seen a twilight movie in my life, 
gimmie a break.
Were you expecting this to be a movie, or a porno?
See above
oh Vera... be my mom, please.....
This movie is about people that isolates themselved from their social life 
why i dont know everybody has different reasons but in the end he went back 
to the place he belonged "up in the air"
So i just finished this movie and it's a lot better than the trailer, i 
really enjoyed it
i dont even think of him that way he's old.. lol that just cracked me up
Personally I found this movie to be very charming and relaxing. Don't let 
one poor review spoil a good film! :D 
Anna Kendrick , you're amazing , you absolutely are my favorited actress
 came here from chelsea fc website, torres recommended it!
Do you think Vera's character's hubby knew she was cheating but just 
accepted it as alot of woman do that for the sake of the kids?

Eminem is in the movie :D﻿
Tae poop fuck you puta ka﻿
All of the humor in this movie was provided by Jonah Hill. This movie was 
so unfunny that I forgot that it was supposed to be a comedy.
Reign Over Me, 50 First Dates, Punch-Drunk-Love,
he dies.
Two films were he seemed interested in acting and showed some genuine 
talent and not simply phoning it in for a paycheck like all of his other 
movies.
BABABOOYA
I just love how adam sandler's character's movies are a satire of actual 
adam sandler's movies
Fairly good, was nice to see Adam Sandler in a movie with Jonah Hill and 
Seth Rogen for once. I usually hate Adams movies
what the fuck.. . I just saw the trailer and was about to write "I just 
watched the whole movie in the trailer" But everybody already did it.... 
That's youtube for ya! 
WOW you spoiled it you could of just left a warning

It's Michael Scarn!﻿
poor choice-the original tvshow is always the best-we had actors hamming it 
up--it stands out--be natural dont try too hard--Terence Stamp, Anne 
Hathaway,excellent as actors--Steve Carell, Dwayne Johnson--pimps--should 
never do movies again-﻿
F@#k this movie.Really the G%$@# comedy ever.﻿
holy shit is that terry crews at 0:56 ??﻿
I went to this movie on a blind date..luckly the movie was good but the guy 
was ughhh﻿
I love the tv show get smart ﻿
Haven't watch this movie since February 2011
she shouldn't be on the phone while driving 
i am starting to love anne hathaway!.... 
1:46 hahahahaha i love dwayne
It was of no fault of Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway, and off the set, they 
get along . However, fans of the original television series found it 
uncomfortable that Hathaway's Agent 99 disliked Carell's Maxwell Smart, 
constantly intimidating and insulting him, until she finds a way to love 
him. That had never happened with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon back in the 
day on television. Then the movie would jump between comedy and action. I 
just liked Carell doing Adams' walk. 
1:33 it's must be painful hahaha
Wtf
that shows just how little you know... it's that 70's show not the 60's show
What a terrible trailer! They showed more than half of the funny scenes of 
the movie...Now,what's the reason for anyone to watch the movie? Fuck! 
Stupid people who make trailers!
mum mum mum mum!! SEAN SEAN SEAN SEAN!!! HHAHHAHA
Only one top comment? My turn! BREASTICLES!!!!!!
does anyone know the name of the song in the end of the trailer
Was that the great khali from wwe
well his mom was a bitch 
Missed it by that much...
That's CIA crap :P
What if Steve Carell had not been available. Who else could ever follow in 
footsteppins of Don Adams? It's like one chance in a thousand and there it 
is
Siegfried: Who are you? Maxwell: my name is Nudnuick Shbilkes, who are you? 
Siegfried: I am Siegfried Maxwell *talkes into mic* did you just say 
SIEGFRIED!?!? 
i hate to think that they might have considered jim carrey :'(

very good movie!﻿
I have never seen this before, but Niall said he watched it 350 times, so I

MORE PEOPLE SAW THIS TRAILER than SAW THE MOVIE.
I'm watching on FIOS. Great movie.﻿
what was wrong with the boy in this movie? He fell and then he bled so 
easily.Can anyone tell me? I don't understand.﻿
 There must not be ANOTHER MOVIE WITH THIS BLUE EYED Girl ANYMORE.. 
PLEASE!! AT LEAST Not In a movie with such good critics, which are not 
true!! I mean.. Honestly She just can't be more cheesy! 
They 3 in charge of this production just couldn't have found a better way 
to make it worse and even more boresome just like all "She" has been in!! 
If you're MORE than 20 yrs old... Don't watch it! Unless you're the mellow 
type! 
Certainly it was intended to be a fashionable Chic Vampire Movie... but 
They forgot to make use of the actresses And make it look hotter and 
astonishing!! Particularly it just ended up being one more of the most 
silly predictable tedious stories we're tired of watching! Such a shameful 
film... Coming from such a Good Deep Director like Him, N.Jordan, 
futuristic though.. BUT actually I would wish so much they 3 could read 
what I'm writing right now. Because.... "A Vampire sexy outrageous slutty 
Movie like this one.... honestly CAN AND SHALL HAVE much more stunning 
scenes with dirty nasty action cuts.. with an energetic tremendous plot 
full of lust.. blood.. Sex.. Emotional Passional Pain.. luxury and real 
well-done outfit. 
Dude... this film had all to work out.. and become a new smash... In a 
vampire 'Pulp Fiction' Style!! Muak!! ﻿
The Actor's did great but definitely a predictable movie and nothing 
outstanding﻿
i got my DAMN nose broken by gemma! all i said was hi and then POW! da 
hell's wrong wit her x(﻿
Susie Salmon, you lived!﻿
trailer was pretty bad not sure if i would like it﻿
I don't normally like #vampire movies, but #Byzantium was a wonderful 
surprise. Quite enjoyable. #movie ﻿
Lovely little flick, you should watch it﻿
BYZANTIUM is not your usual vampire fare and with the glut of horrible 
vampire-related stories and films of recent years this is a good thing. The 
movie itself is haunting, both in story and mood; the acting stellar and it 
has Neil Jordan written all over it. Again, another good thing.

I like odd stories, which this one seemed from the first trailer I came 
across. Added to my list, I'd forgotten about it until I ran across it 
again when looking up new films. So glad I did.

You will not find any sparkly, teen angsty nonsense here. And if you are 
looking for mindless gore, don't bother. If you'd like to be entertained by 
a story and characters which draw you in from the start, then you're in the 
right place.

#RAisMovies  gives it a 5 droplets out of 5...﻿
This is hands down, the best vampire movie I've ever seen.  It's a 
fantastic love story --love/hate between a mother and daughter.  Intense.﻿
just one fuckin reason why i watched it... its Gemma Arterton. TOTALLY 
WORTH IT.
Actually the movie was suck as fuck... :D﻿
What kind of vampire cant break out of handcuffs???? They made them so weak 
but otherwise it was a good movie﻿
Great movie! !  ! !﻿
Watch this trailer
Buen trailer﻿
cool﻿
Why is this called Byzantium? I thought I was going to see a Byzantine 
empire trailer.﻿
I am so sick of all these fairies tale lifestyle movies it has come to me 
that im done but this unfortunately looks very good﻿
The song's name is: Brand X Music - World Without End﻿
[Spoiler Alert]
I think Clara is just as hypocritical as The brotherhood, which supposedly 
upholds justice in this movie. She said she wanted to punish those who prey 
on the weak and yet she became a Madam/pimp, selling clueless young girls, 
which she used to be....﻿
wrong name  for a wrong movie title!﻿
I never hear about movies starring Saoirse Ronan. Did this already come out 
or....?﻿
For a moment, I was excited that the movie might actually have something to 
do with the Byzantine Empire.  Alas...it's ANOTHER vampire movie.  If only 
an English-language film were to be made involving the Byzantine 
Empire...so many interesting stories to be told, many of them "epic." ﻿
Please someone tell me the name of the song starting at 1:13 ? Thank you so 
much!﻿
$$$$
wolverine is a lot more interesting and bad ass than any of the other x 
men. He's probably the most bad ass comic book character in general.﻿
Tail story for morons.﻿
This was pretty good. I was willing to make it a favorite of 2013 for me 
that is until I reached the ending. Jesus Christ, I hated that ending. It's 
complete bullshit and it ruined an otherwise well done flick.

If you think Days of Future Past is gonna be any better then prepare to be 
disappointed. Simon Kinberg's writing that one and judging from his resume 
it's gonna bomb pretty hard. I don't care that the Sentinels are in, I 
don't care if Peter Dinklage brings a good performance and I don't fucking 
care that Bryan Singer's back to direct!, it's still gonna suck just as 
much as X-Men 3.... which Kinberg also wrote.

FOX!. PICK A BETTER GODDAMN WRITER NEXT TIME!. GOD!.﻿
This trailer shows WAY too much of the movie...
But I doubt anybody reads the comments before watching the trailer :|﻿
I watched DVD.
Only in the early stages, it is the worst Japanese culture introduction.
When a foreigner makes a movie as a stage in Japan, the belief of the 
producer is emphasized by all means.﻿
Origin of wolverine was better. .the movie was good ending sucked﻿

http://www.zazzle.com/kfleming1986
my zazzle Store.﻿
he is so hooot﻿
i was disappointed , but i do hope they make another movie better than 
this ﻿
In my personal opinion this flim sucks for two reason.

1. How can you remove/serpress his healing abilities it not like he was 
given that like captain America was given his powers or he was in some sort 
of accident and got them like Bruce banner or just wrong place wrong right 
time like Peter parcker he was Born that way its apart of his body's 
genetic make up 

2. And this one really annoyed me the most the chopping off of his claws 
that and the fact that they gave him an origin story has completely spoiled 
the wolverine as a character for me. 

I mean his claws and his unknown past are his character defining features 
with out that there is no uniqueness about him nothing that sets him apart 
form the rest of the character in marvel because there are a few with the 
ability to heal them self instantly like hulk for instance and lots of 
characters with a bad attitude like cable or the punished but hey thats 
just my opinion. ﻿
EWWWWWWW﻿
Soooo is he without adamantium now or idk?!?﻿
I really enjoyed this movie last year ;) Bring on the sequel...﻿
I only got one special question to ask jack and the people over here: 
Howcome the guy never wears the wolverine outfit in wolverine or do men 
movies??﻿
Saw the extended version. Solid f**king movie. Too bad DofP will overwrite 
all of what happens in it.﻿
*"The Wolverine"* stays true to the comics, the Japanese arc of the comics 
is easily "Wolverine's best story and this movie delivers more than 
justice!" Best superhero movie of the summer.
From the beginning I thought that this movie *would the worse superhero 
movie of the year*. But after exiting the cinema I was stunned, it was 
literally "a huge surprise". *Hugh Jackman kicks ass as the Wolverine like 
always and all the other actors* did a solid job. The story was awesome, it 
was nice to see the Wolverine in another way; mortal and vulnerable. There 
where awesome fight scenes and the script/conversations where decent. The 
ending was a surprise which I loved. *I loved the envirenment, Japan and 
Tokia was interesting and beautiful*, not like Origins (which was a sh*t 
movie, dont watch it). Overall, The Wolverine is one of the best action 
movies this year in my opinion

*WOLVERINE 2013* ++﻿
1,000,000,000 times better than Origins.﻿
So cccccccccoooooooooolllllllllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
This movie starts out staggeringly dumb. The Japanese,  world renown for 
their humane treatment of prisoners of war in 1945,  graciously empty their 
POW cages to give the guys a shot at surviving a nuclear blast. If you turn 
off your brain it's kind of mindlessly entertaining in spots.﻿
Hello everyone, I have just found full leaked version of this movie, so I 
think it could help you. I have just watched it and I am amazed. It might 
be the the best movie this year! Version which I found is really good 
quality (1080p as I can see). I found it here: 
*Movies 2013. c o*
 I hope it will help you,  if it helped  thumb up like it so other people 
can find it easily and watch it :) Best wishes to everyone :)﻿
Wow, *.*﻿
Silver samurai=iron man?? Lol
Shitty plot, shitty characters, shitty acts etc..
The movie was horrible.﻿
liked this film cos of buff hugh.plot wasn't too good tho﻿
The Katana is movie weapon star!﻿
i am neutral with this movie﻿

#Thor is back! The trailer for Marvel's #ThorDarkWorld is LIVE, exclusively 
from YouTube’s #GeekWeek! bit.ly/1750vdU Check it out now!﻿
The ending saved the movie﻿
why they show eather (in tradition was the spirit of 5 elements) as bad 
thing? thats really suspicius..﻿
I just realized that Malekith's voice was different in this than the movie﻿
Totally ruins nordic mythologi.﻿
Malekith was cool character though,,,﻿
i fell asleep watching the trailer﻿
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help, I mean Hulk, Iron 
man, Captain America, you could have called any of them yet you choose the 
one person you can't trust.
Thor: Actually now that I think about it you're right! *Walks away*
Loki: No, come back! I was only joking! ﻿
First movie Thor was million times better than this one. Dark world is so 
boring...﻿
How come nobody else has pointed out how ANNOYING Kat Dennings is in this 
movie. Not to mention, unfunny!﻿
Those of you who want real Nordic mythology must see Valhalla!!﻿
After meeting iron man in the avengers I feel like thor got more of a sense 
of humor﻿
IM TOTALLY GOING TO WATCH THIS﻿
Shit*﻿
Horrible script! Even those awesome actors couldn't save it. Worst Natalie 
Portman performance I must say. Her little comedic effort was just 
cringeworthy. Ugh!﻿
Can someone please explain to me why the Thor movies insist on removing the 
fantasy aspects from Thor and replacing them with Science Fiction. I mean 
they literally had Asgard protected by a force field and laser canons, 
while the Dark Elves flew around on space ships. Worse they actually have 
Odin say that they aren't gods. Its like they aren't even trying to follow 
the storyline for the character.﻿
This movie was shallow. It didn't have a clear objective, just stuff 
happening. It kind of felt like a shitty episode from some tv show.﻿
Jane looks like an older Katniss﻿
Love Thor but i think this movie is only ok. ﻿
I can tell by the trailer that this movie was shit! I put it at the top of 
my queue on Netflix. Is it even worth it? Lol﻿
In some scenes with the background settings Natalie Portman is just like in 
Star Wars , but she cheats Anakin. Bitch!﻿
The ending to this movie wow omg you really won't see it coming ﻿
Movie is better than iron man 3﻿
I think that still of Thor and Loki walking side by side is epic. 1:29﻿
I can't believe this movie is already out on DVD i didnt even hear much 
about it either i feel like it was only out in theatres for like 3 weeks 
haha﻿
$$$$
It was better than watching paint dry﻿
damn has it been a year already? time flies﻿
I don't hate Man of Steel, but I still prefer the first Christopher Reeve 
Superman and the Richard Donner Cut of Superman 2. I loved Henry Cavill as 
Superman, but I hope the script is better for the sequel.﻿
One of the best superman movies out there to date!!! Everyone hating on 
this movie and their excuse is "there was too much action". Too much 
action? This is a Superman movie for crying out loud. Of course skyscrapers 
and whole cities will get destroyed. What do you expect? I mean I thought 
the action was sufficient and wanted more action.﻿
See, a lot of people seem to either hate or love this movie...I for one am 
on the fence. It did a lot of things right, but it also did some things 
wrong.

Before I continue, I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed Man of Steel. What 
I loved about this movie is that it does extremely well on an emotional 
level building up to the appearance of General Zod on Earth. Then when he 
finally arrives, it does begin to veer off-course into generic action movie 
clichés--the government trying to find out what the strange UFO is, etc.. 
Also, the poignant undertone of the film is lost, drowned out by the 
blaring action. A lot of people complain about all the destruction is 
caused while Superman and Zod fight, and I for one agree with that. It 
would have been more compelling if Clark had been at least attempting to 
keep the battle away from the city, away from where it could danger human 
lives. Also, Jor-El talks about Clark helping the people of Earth, and he 
does, but not enough of a personal level for me to fully believe in him as 
a hero.

And yes, the natural argument is that this is Superman's first mission. 
He's going to be a little green at it, and I get that, but the fact that he 
continues to throw Zod and the other Kryptonians around through buildings 
when any average person would realize that danger just makes me see him 
(and the film) in a less positive light.﻿
"he'll be a god to them" cue shivers down my spine﻿
this movie was badass and it was the best superman movie ever!! all the 
people hating are stupid!!﻿
Loved this movie!!!
Can't wait for the sequel!!!﻿
Man of Steel was so disappointing. Even more disappointing is the fact that 
DC/Warner Bros have decided to continue with the Batman VS. Superman movie. 
I can't even begin to explain how many mistakes DC is making, again and 
again and again (even though I could rant about it for DAYS). I feel really 
bad for hardcore DC fans, to be honest, because they're not getting the 
movies or the DC cinematic universe that they deserve. ﻿
Henry Cavill is Just A Beautiful Man, Like can I Marry Him?﻿
The trailers for MOS represent the greatest movie trailers of all time.﻿
This movie was epic.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  This is the 
most true to the comics superhero movie I have seen.﻿
Man of steel was a decent movie, but it had a big impact on my life when 
the movie came out. At the time I was in a very depressed and hopeless time 
and it helped pushed me forward, helped inspire me, motivate me, and gave 
me: Hope. I think the overall message of hope was pretty well conveyed in 
my opinion.﻿
Everyone should know that "clark" was rookie about being superman, if you 
see, clark is superman for the first time in the movie, and in just ONE day 
all the problems start to came out, (ZOD). You shouldn't expected that the 
scenes will be awesome, and he will fight like a big superhero. NOO,. he's 
just a man that discovered his truly powers and don't have any idea of how 
to fight or defeat evil. 
Remember MAN OF STEEL movie is just the beginning  of the story of 
superman.﻿
If you guys want to see a over dub of the world engine scene with hancock's 
sountrack please headover to my channel to check it out. ﻿
Why do critics hate on this and green lantern? They weren't even bad 
movies. This is what WB/DC should do:
1.Confirm that GL and MOS are in the same universe.
2. Release a WW solo movie afterwards
3. Release a Flash solo movie(have Hal Jordan mentioned), and the rest of 
the heroes, batman must have a cameo.)
4. make a green lantern sequel(have sinestro turn evil, therefore leading 
into a yellow lantern invasion, which leads to a JL movie)﻿
This movie had *WAY* too much stuff blowing up.﻿
trailer > movie...﻿
yeah. it wasn't very good, was it? hans zimmer's score was cool, though. ﻿
This was the worst movie of 2013, Superman is destined to be Superman 
enough with that fucking lazy bullshit trope why does every god damn hero 
need a destiny, isn't that retarded I am jesus trope bad enough.﻿
Zoom in, Zoom out, Zoom in, Zoom out, shacky cams everywhere, Zoom in, Zoom 
out... Yes! Zack is such a visual director!!﻿
why would superman needs an auto stop???﻿
Anyone who complains about Metropolis being torn to pieces has probably 
never read a Superman comic before.  Or any comic featuring superheroes. 
 Wrecking up the city is a standard feature.﻿
Best super hero movie yet﻿
Don't get why so many people didn't like this, complaining that it's not 
like the original Superman movies. No shit, we don't want a bunch of movies 
that are just remakes of the previous. I love this movie, it's all about 
self discovery and saving earth. ﻿

Can someone tell me in which alien dimension Elmont got his armor?﻿
Jack only slayed one damn Giant﻿
I knew the two headed giant looked familiar!  they STOLE the face of the 
main head from CGI character Beowulf (of the same movie). Tweaked a little 
and older and meaner, it's the same basic face.﻿
is that the same asshole from warm bodies, i want to punch him so much﻿
i was totally expecting this movie to be lame but I gave it a chance last 
night and really enjoyed it. its a shame it didnt do too well with the box 
office...﻿
Hey guys if you like titans vs humans idea you should cheak out anime 
Shingeki no Kyojin (attack on titan), trust me you woun't be sorry﻿
I loved this movie!  Hope they do a second one.﻿
Attack on titan if they were british :DDDD﻿
Worse costume design in a period type movie, armor looked like rubber with 
shiny rhinestones stuck to it. Overall flick was ok, but just looked so 
damn cheesy.﻿
This trailer spoiled the whole movie for me.﻿
This is just like Shingeki no Kyojin...﻿
He slayed 3 giants, the cook, the guard and the leader.﻿
And thats how R (worm bodyes) Died .﻿
Nephilim race﻿
If attack on Titan was real ﻿
great trailer but the movie not so much i was expecting more action  ﻿
Watching it right now have the movie﻿
is it Ian Mckellen speaking at the beginning ?﻿
A great fantasy movie for the whole family. Really nice to watch. 7.1/10﻿
awesome film!! i just finished watching it. Really enjoyed it. you know you 
enjoyed a film if you go back after to watch the trailer again! lol i'd 
give it 7.8/10﻿
I really enjoyed this movie..quite entertaining and the visual effects just 
splendid..I hope they make a sequel..﻿

hugely entertaining film.Highly recommended.﻿

I love love love the movie and the trailer's song. I wish I could get my 
hands on those books though!!!﻿
love this movie﻿
i am always repeting this movie﻿
I LOVE THIS MOVIE AND THE BOOK MAN I LOVE IT
Today is the release date n i havent finish reading!!! noooo
doesn't matter, Still doesn't look like a 16 years old boy! what would you 
say if they picked a 15 years old guy to play Harry Potter in the first 
movie? 
me too
I think that this movie looks amazing! I haven't read the books and usually 
like to read the books first but never mind, maybe it won't matter too 
much! Everyone has to accaept that no movie is going to be exactly like the 
film! Harry Potter and Twilight came close but even they changed things for 
those films. I don't see what's wrong with the cast really....but to be 
fair I was annoyed when they changed stuff on Secret Circle. I am curious 
to see what this film is like! 
yeah noticed that 
yess not him not himmmm
This is like the witches version of twilight.
thank you i wanted to know the song :D
movie was so bad it was nothing like the book the book is so much betterr 
florence!! :D
proof that having florence and the machine in your trailer can make the 
movie seem way more epic than it actually is. I was so disappointed. The 
visuals were cool, the directing and screenplay needed work.
The characters will probably never look the way you originally imagined 
since everyone has a different picture in their minds, it's impossible to 
please everyone. I think people should learn to separate the movie from the 
book, they are two separate art forms and as long as the movie stays true 
to the themes and story I don't see why we should complain because whatever 
happens we still have the book. The movie can never destroy that. 
How can people even criticize that the movie isn't like the book? The movie 
hasn't even come out yet!
that house looks great!
I'm reading the book right now and this movie looks really stupid, and the 
characters all look wrong
Check out my new channel for lots of new Movie trailers.
The cast are a total let down..... Just hope the movie effects can make it 
up. 
I seriously hope they make a remake of this movie. These characters are 
NOTHING like the book said they looked like... like you know how they were 
making so many Sleeping Beauty movies in one year? I want another movie, 
but BETTER, but I hope if it does come out, I hope it comes out in 2013... 
They should actually have teenagers to act it out, since they were teens. 
If they can't find anyone, then find someone like 18 or 19, not in their 
TWENTIES. -_- I expected Ethan to be dreamy :(
I thought ethan was light haired? 0_o

Just watched the movie again. even if you have seen this movie a million 
times, heres the trailer! ﻿
So what's the point in using two Iron Man movies in Phase 1 then he'll be 
left out in Phase 3?that's what I don't get﻿
+EvilSCIENTIST I've never seen anyone say that Blade was a bad movie, only 
the 3rd. But either way, Bruce had about 2 or 3 weeks to get back to Gotham 
after escaping the pit. If TDKR's plot holes are explainable, then so are 
the Avengers. Bruce Banner has control of the Hulk, we learned that at the 
end of the Incredible
Hulk movie, that doesn't mean that he still can't lose his grip on that 
control, where the Hulk's rage completely takes over, like the scene on the 
Helicarrier. He knew that New York was where he needed to go because well, 
he's a genius, like Tony Stark he based it off of Loki's previous 
motivations and actions, also the portal in the sky was probably a 
giveaway. What scene are you reffering to about them leaving Loki alone? If 
it's when Thor and Iron Man were fighting, well, simply put, their egos got 
in the way, which is why Tony attacked Thor first, they also figured that 
once they took care of the other then they could easily just go and get 
Loki.﻿
Why does the hulk look so much different in this then in the Incredible 
Hulk﻿
I'm probably the only guy saying this, but that scene of black widow 
standing still while something behind her is blowing up........, why? I 
know its supposed to be sexy, but why couldn't it have been a scene of her 
fighting. I doubt she would just stand still sexually while a battle is 
going on around her.﻿
As a trash little kid movie shore﻿
I watched it in theaters great movie﻿
I love this movie. <3﻿
Roggers never speak of Starks dad who shearch for him﻿
I maybe hating on Hollywood movies I mean I love the graphics and action 
and it's very exciting but sometimes I feel that these alien beings (in 
almost every American movie) that want to attack Earth ALWAYS attack New 
York City first and the ones protecting Earth ALMOST ALWAYS defend America 
instead of other countries making us want to assume that America IS the 
world. I MEAN COME ON! There are other cities and countries in the world 
LMAO!!! Or maybe it's the same old American propaganda bullshit distributed 
in these "cool" action movies.﻿
awsome﻿
2,5 years later.. this is a pretty bad trailer﻿
Copadoo! =))﻿
Love It cant wait for #2﻿
ROBIN SCHERBATSKY YOU GOT POWERS﻿
The crash occurred about 5:40 p.m. Thursday on Interstate 5 north of 
Highway 32, when a FedEx semi-truck collided with a tour bus filled with 
high school students. Both caught on fire.

The bus was carrying students from several Los Angeles-area high schools to 
visit Humboldt State for its Spring Preview for prospective students today 
and Saturday. Three buses were traveling together but only one was involved 
in the crash.

As many as 10 ground ambulances and four helicopters were sent to the area 
to evacuate the injured. Authorities this morning said 31 people were 
transported to seven hospitals from Sacramento to Redding. There were 48 in 
the tour bus.

Southbound I-5 has reopened, but northbound lanes at the crash scene are 
still closed. A detour has been established.

At a press conference this morning, Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones said 
it will be a difficult task to positively identify some of the victims in 
the charred wreckage.

Sheriff Jones said the last body was removed from the scene about 1:40 a.m. 
The FedEx truck was being removed at 8:15 this morning.

CHP Lt. Scott Fredrick from the accident investigation team said the 
investigation will take months to complete.

In a press release issued this morning, Enloe Medical Center reported it 
received a total of 11 patients. At 10:30 a.m., Enloe said the two patients 
in the worst condition were upgraded from critical to serious. Three 
patients remain in fair condition and six have been released.﻿

is? and you hardly see "avengers was better than this shit" but you go to
