the best trilogy of all time<3﻿
I know I am a bit late in becoming a LOTR fan. I have a few questions if 
any of you would be kind enough to answer. Question number 1) How many 
types of " races " happen to be in this trilogy?
2) Who are/is Valar? 3) I know the lluvatar is like God, so why won't he 
kill Sauron to end all this? 4) Who created Sauron in the first place? 5) 
Why didn't Sauron turn the 3 Elven Rings " evil " ? 6) Are all the movies 
the same plot? Are they all 1 adventure cut into three pieces? 
My last question: Can anyone write a list of every important character and 
define them? Who they are or what they are supposed to do?

This would be massive help to me, I started yesterday evening (12 hours 
ago), so I am missing some crucial answers.

Thank you﻿
It never gets old. 👍﻿
I remember when the movie came out. I was so excited and couldnt wait to 
see it. I was sure though I wouldnt see it on opening day. That day, after 
I got home from school, I relaxed at home for a bit but then mom and dad 
said they were going to see a movie and told me to come along. I knew 
though it wouldnt be Return of the King since they never saw the other 
movies. But when we got to the theatre and got our tickets they said the 
movie and I just jumped up and down in excitement.

We had to wait in line for an hour and a half in front of the theatre. The 
people coming out from the previous showing were cheering and I knew it 
would be good. 3 and a half hours later, I came out with a huge smile on my 
face and almost crying.

I still watch the films to this day. :)﻿
No offence but luckily there were no jews to ruin this film!!!﻿
No Denethor or Faramir? Seriously?﻿
Easily one of the BEST trailers (and films) in cinema history.﻿
Sorry guys but this trilogy was FAR more superior to Harry Potter's 8 
films...

FAN DEBATE!!!!﻿
star wars is better though?﻿
These movies will never become old, the CGI is not very much in these 
movies, and the CGI there is, is very good. These movies will live for MANY 
years. They are perfect.﻿
Now its a decade old. for such a film, this doesnt look a day old! :D﻿
One of the few movies that are way better that the trailers. I mean its 
like the movie is divine stuff and trailers suck :D﻿
best film of all time.﻿
My god... this trailer is amazing. The Return of the King has to be one of 
the greatest movies of all time! Seeing this trailer just brings it all 
back for me. It was the winter of 2003, i had just graduated college and i 
saw it with my roommate, a girl i was dating and my mom and i swear i 
must've cried at least 3 times throughout. Especially at the end, when Sam 
carries Frodo up the side of Mount Doom.. holyshit, i was balling! I loved 
everything about it, it was so goddamned entertaining and engaging; a 
completely emotional experience. The action, the drama, the music, the 
make-up, the incredible visual effects and the realism of Gollum... i could 
go on and on. After waiting so long and seeing each film every Christmas, i 
felt like I'd experienced the journey with them, i felt so connected to all 
the characters. The build up and the excitement was insane. These films are 
truly a masterpiece. I'm really enjoying the Hobbit now as well and they 
seem to be getting better with each film, but i think i will always be 
partial to LOTR's. May the Maiar bless you Peter Jackson for what you have 
created and may your work always be remembered and revered for all time Mr. 
Tolkien. Truly, you were a literary genius! Thank you for sharing 
your books with the world.﻿
I really really love the hobbit movies and coming from a person who read 
the books first and preferred the hobbit these new movies dont feel to me 
like say the star wars prequels as they do to others. I like the lighter 
tone but I wish it were more serious at times. I really do it never feels 
like theyre in any danger, just when i feel like the new one is more in 
line with lotr a fucking dwarf starts taking out orcs by rolling a barrel 
over them. Like come on youre not letting me feel the emotions i felt in 
lotr when it was like they werent going to succeed. Also wtf was that 
liquid gold about man come one. I was so in love with that movie until that 
scene. In awe of Cumbies performance and feeling bilbos fear in my heart 
and then swoop they pull the rug out from under my by balancing thorin on 
the nose of a 200 ft tall  fucking dragon and riding a wheel barrel. I was 
literally cringing and thinking why o why did you just ruin it for me.﻿
I know those movies by heart, but even the trailers give me chills. 
They are the bests of all time.﻿
Rewatching this film, does anyone feel that the Hobbit films feel and look 
low budget in comparison, they also feel too family friendly with the 
choice of music and jokes. ﻿
Wow the trailer is awesome but the movie is even better. You don't see that 
very often﻿
This cinematic masterpiece, unrivaled, will be ten years old in 15 
days....DANG﻿
it's an epic tale 
yep.
what is the Epic Track called at 1:40 ? *_*
Damn it, I watched this and started crying. DAMN YOU PETER JACKSON AND JRR

What the fuck, the trailer is so shitty it makes the movie look terrible. 
This is one of the greatest movies ever made but trailers are usually 
misleading just all the new movies have awesome trailer but suck. Watch it

Hahaha you sound like an ignorant child that never completed the first

you a Porch Monkey (you don't like it do you, well too bad, "Do onto others 
what you wish them to do on to you"), if you don't understand the concept

This is such an amazing bloody film! One of my favorites from one of my 
favorite actors Leonardo DiCaprio! A brilliant film, a brilliant cast and a 
brilliant director directing it!﻿
This was the last movie Leo looked young in, he couldn't play a kid in 
anything after this anymore! I remember him playing a kid or really young 
guy all the time lol. After this he bulked up and has grown into a fine 
young man. I thought he would look young forever! lol﻿

only scorsese can make a movie that would be better than the trailer 
suggests...﻿

I'm almost done reading the book. I'll probably check the movie out. (:
one of the best drama movies ever, i cried at many parts of the film, it 
was the only one which really touched my heart :(
Kevin Bacon's two well thought out movies are Mystic River, and A few good

This movie wasnt... that great? good acting and all but man a dull story﻿
If you liked Fargo, you'll probably like this one... but if you didn't 
(like me) you will not.
It's not the begining, nor the end of a story, it's the middle of one. 
There's some great acting, but it's (in my view) wasted in a uninteresting 
plot and a uneventful story. There's some interesting dialogues, a lot of 
killing and lots of blood, however there's no action, no drama, no 
thrill... But it did won an Oscar (not that means anything nowadays), so I 
leave it up to you...
See it and judge for yourselves.﻿
One of the best acting i have ever seen by Javier Bardem! The next one by 
Christoph Waltz at Inglourious Basterds!﻿
I hate cheesy, corny, dumb happy endings.  I  love this movie so much. 
 It's gritty and tense.  All the actors were so good even the little 
supporting roles, and Bardem was awesome as Chigurh.  It's not formulaic, 
it's not predictable, it's not a feel good movie.  It reminds me of the 
tone of a lot of foreign non-Hollywood movies.  ﻿
Is this movie worth it (Blu-ray) Used for $4.83?? I plan on buying it to 
see it, what do y'all say??﻿
Gta?﻿
I love this film, the best part is when he is in the gas station with old

How many Cohen brother movies involve the name Llewelyn? ﻿

This film was brilliant﻿
The best part about this movie is *SPOILER* you think you're watching an 
action thriller and then it ends you realize you were watching a drama with 
a commentary on life and it's stages. The end angered me and then about 20 
min later it clicked and now I can't wait to watch it again ﻿
Actors in this film performed so well, the got nominated for an award﻿

What was up with the ending of this damned movie? I was so pissed at the 
ending, the movie was excellent up until then. Any ending is better than NO 
ending. It's like the movie ended in the middle! I also hated that you know 
who got killed (in case you haven't seen it, not saying who), but they 
never showed his body so I thought it was a faked death right up until the 
credits rolled. WTF??? A bad ending, a sad ending, a happy ending, but SOME 
damned ending, would have been nice. This is what I watched last night, any 
suggestions for tonight and please, nothing this screwed up. i really loved 
this movie until then too, lol.﻿

this movie was fucking exciting to watch my heart was racing and shizz
That FUCKING door nob scene! YOU KNOW its coming YOU KNOW! yet you still 
fucking jump out of your seat! 
Yes, well I think the off-screen death just enriches the punch to it, like 
Omni pointed out, you don't expect it, making it more realistic. I don't 
see why it has to be over-dramatized like every single movie ever, then it 
wouldn't be unique, it's a way of saying that the perspective of the plot 
doesn't change the outcome of the plot, and that's exactly why I love this 
movie. "Just looking for what's coming", "well no one ever sees that". 
great film.

Sorry gonna need more than that to get me interested, looks very boring and 
with a title like that I actually want to see some blood in the trailer, 
yall so easily ammused
Great movie but i do think it is overated, it isnt the best movie of 2011. 
And No Country For Old men is even more overated. That movie was a big 
disapointment
Ok, well I didn't mean any offense by it. I'm just glad you liked the movie 
(I am assuming you did by the comment).
LOL how come Paul Dano always seems to get hit at some point in most of his 
movies? Ha idk just pointing it out.. i love that boy, amazing actor! I 
really wanna see this movie
yes..good movie...I'm betting you were surprised to see me at the Berlinale 
premiere
1.58 the laugh of Satan...
The movie's a little slow, but it's pretty good nonetheless. It's more for 
the observant and thinking person than the one looking for a good action 
flick. In short, it's based on the book Oil! by Upton Sinclair, and is a 
study of Religion and Greed. Brother Eliah is based on Reverend Aimee 
Semple McPherson, who found my denomination, the International Church of 
the Foursquare Gospel. Interesting story, you should wiki it if you get the 
chance.
When I saw this movie for the first time, I saw Daniel Plainview as an 
utterly evil character, but the second time I saw it, I saw him as 
extremely sympathetic. He truly worked hard to achieve his success, and you 
could tell in the earlier parts of the movie that he really loved his son a 
lot. When his son goes deaf, the obsessively competitive part of him begins 
to hate his son for the inconvenience that he causes, but you can see the 
emotion in his face when he leaves his son on the train.
15 year old kid is touchy touchy
That laugh at the end. It's brilliant.
In a way it is.
Well, so's your face. ;)
PTA doesn't want to have a classic fairy tale ending, he wants to have more 
of a realistic ending to portrey what the characters life was really like. 
The movie is basically about life and people getting in each others way to 
get what they want....its everywhere just look around. It's about how hard 
it must have been to do what he did at that time from scratch, persistence, 
and people misusing Christianity to get what they want...Eli. Its very 
interesting and intruiging if you keep watching.
Amazing film. One of the best performances in ever since gangs of new York.
I saw this movie last night... breathtaking. The movie was an amazement, it 
was unbelievable. One of my favorite movies of all time, and easily one of 
the greatest films made since the turn of the century.
@dillonator its not a bad movie but i didn't deserve its awards its a good 
movie but a not the master piece a lot of people think it is 
I believe that as well. I definetly think anyone 17+ should see this movie. 
(17+ because some people might get lost in what all is happening) If anyone 
is watching this trailer and is thinking of renting it, PLEASE DO. You will 
not be disappointed in any way.
Also, Daniel and Eli are really after the same thing, but Eli is using a 
religious front that he himself may not even be full aware of if 
confronted. Daniel, while greedy is straighforward about his greed and 
therefore sees himself as much more noble than Eli even though they have 
the same financial desires.
great movie (again the trailer simply does not do it justice but what to do)
whoa 1:40 better not be a gay scene...>>

I need to feel strongly, to love and admire, just as desperately as I need 
to breathe-Jean Dominique Bauby ﻿
﻿
None
Ppl may not know who Bauby was, so here's the following. His case closely 
resembles mine in the beginning. Knowing who he was may help others know 
who I am.

Jean-Dominique Bauby (French: 23 April 1952 – 9 March 1997) was a 
well-known French journalist, author and editor of the French fashion 
magazine ELLE.

On 8 December 1995 at the age of 43, Bauby suffered a massive stroke. When 
he woke up twenty days later, he found he was entirely speechless; he could 
only blink his left eyelid. Called locked-in syndrome, this is a condition 
wherein the mental faculties remain intact but most of the body is 
paralyzed. In Bauby's case his mouth, arms, and legs were paralyzed,Despite 
his condition, he wrote the book The Diving Bell and the Butterfly by 
blinking when the correct letter was reached by a person slowly reciting 
the alphabet over and over again using a system called partner assisted 
scanning. Bauby composed and edited the book entirely in his head, and 
dictated it one letter at a time. (This came from Wikipedia 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Dominique_Bauby as we don't need 
specifics. Do use a couple resources if looking for something very 
important.)



It was the same eye for me. I say "when I opened my eyes", but rly it was 
only 1 eye. The movie is the same title as his book. The movie has 
subtitles. U can prolly rent it. I saw it on cable.﻿
@PAGATY what's wrong with it being in french? if you just turn the

Appreciate absolutely everything, even your body, maybe even so far to 
appreciate your own mind and its thought, and your feelings... how far can 
you go? If every single thing is appreciate, where do YOU stand? Who is the 
appreciator?
@FilthyReech Your Hand In Mine by Explosions In The Sky. You should 
definitely check out their other music too, it's truly beautiful.
cinematography looks beautiful. I'm excited to see the 'making of' haha. 
if this happened to me i'd listen to an epic amount of music
trapped in this body and i just can't get out
@Safaraportugal Thank you so much, I was searching for this and you got 
that all in one ! Kisses from Slovakia ;)
One of the hardest movies i have seen in my life.I saw this movie,when i 
had a randevous with a girl(we shouldn`t go for this movie),it was 2 years 
ago,but i still remember whole movie,like i saw it yeasterday. This movie 
tells - enjoy your life,till you got that chance !
@FilthyReech Expolosions in the Sky - Your Hand in Mine
this movie makes me appreciate life...
wanna watch this so baaaad
Explosions in the sky - Your hand in mine <3
@rapstreetz You, sir, are a ****ing moron
this movie is great...touches ur heart
Yes he had a stroke which should've killed him but due to the advances in 
modern science we have now-a-days he was revived but the damage was already 
done and he was paralyzed in his entire body except for his eyes, but only 
the left could blink, and the other could not so they had to sew that one 
shut. He wrote the entire book "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly" by 
blinking his left eye when a nurse would say a letter. He passed away about 
a week after the book was published, wonderful book
Anyone who liked this movie will like Into the Wild. Similar kind of 
allegorical tale. 
this is where i learned about explosions in the sky <3
just ordered this, cant wait to see it

This is my second favorite movie of all time... behind Boogie Nights.﻿
Love is the only word for depiction.
I make a point of watching this movie once a year.
Exactly how does this film have the same style as Bergman? I found it 
sometimes slightly reminiscent of Ozu, but in a modern, more banal way.
Thank you for this trailer!
This is simply a great film...
I just saw this film. This beats anything I've seen of French New Wave, 
Igmar Bergman, Even Fellini. 这个电影给了我很深刻的印象。
but in terms of who is the greater filmmaker, it's bergman. but i don't 
think on these terms when it comes to both these directors. there is little 
use to even compare filmmakers in this calibur anyway. 
so funny cute little boy 0:21 lol
I love Bergman, but I always feel like it's kind of preachy. Like he's 
giving a lecture about his point of view in life. Not really in a 
self-righteous, arrogant way, but still... This film has the same style of 
Bergman, but let's you take your own conclusions. It doesn't hand you down 
a certain belief to oblige... 
too different from french new wave or fellini...but better than bergman? i 
don't know about that, but it's up there in my book with him

Hopefully Hawkeye and Falcon can team up again soon.﻿

Avatar 2: Releasing 2015. Plot synopsis: The RDA, unbound by the Outer

extinction, and mining teams in Hazmat suits mine the unobtanium. Done. Too 
expensive? Well Unobtanium happens to sell for 20 million a kilo and they 
have it all. Yay. Go Humans!﻿
suck movie﻿
i can't believe 4 years have passed!﻿
It proves more money doesn't necessarily make a good movie :(﻿
Look people, you can deny for all you want, but the facts don't lie. Over 
2.7 BILLIONS made at the box office means a great load of people loved the 
movie! I'm sorry it didn't have that ''Avatar'' feeling on you, but I've 
experienced it and it was amazing! I didn't have any expectations 
whatsoever and I think it paid a lot.

The plot is not that complicated, but the detailed world and the dynamic of 
the movie was incredible. Not once did I noticed the computer generated 
animations that were the Navi's, maybe because I suspended my disbelief for 
three hours.

I really don't understand some critics saying the story lacked complexity 
while critics are covering with gold the ''Gravity'' movie which has less 
story developpment. It's like a hero, some people like to bring him down. 
''Avatar'' was exceptionnal, period.﻿
A very entertaining movie.

It marked a turning point in the year 2009, when we had finally kicked out 
Bush Jr, and sworn in Obama. Dubya and Cheney left the political scene with 
their hotly opposed wars and subsequent major economic collapse, this movie 
makes a nice response to the obscene orgy of war violence aka The War On 
Terror and it's darkness that gripped the world's attention for the better 
part of the 2000s...﻿
In the history of Hollywood movies, one of the best and costly movie is

{James Cameron-AVATAR}
They have used $237 million and they have earn $2,782,275,172.﻿
I just love it!﻿
Just in case… ;-)﻿
I still haven't seen Avatar. I think I was just turned off by the whole 
hyped up 3D thing, so I had negative associations with this movie. Just 
came across this trailer and now it's high on my list. Might try and watch 
it this weekend.﻿
Aw man that was a waste of 10 bucks at the theater! , , , Could've just 
watched this trailer﻿
boring﻿
is it a culture spear darli!a very good morning,sad﻿
I love this trailer but when I saw the complete movie it wasn't that 
amazing.
Not today, but this type of story has been done so many times. It's nothing 
groundbreaking is what the guy probably tried to say. The story is not very 
original. 
Best Movie !!!
Still, nothing of this scale had been done to that point.
How is this unoriginal?
What is this soundtrack?? Please,answer.
From what. The regurgitation of the american film industry. Or the fact 
that movie studios are to scared to put money into something new so they 
churn over the same crap for a new generation. Tell me....... 
The dialogue totally rapes this movie for me... It's just so 
cheesy...."well I guess we better stop him"....ugh...
$$$$
Indeed, not only a masterpiece but Lynch's best and my favorite movie of 
all time.
this trailer doesnt do the film justice. Mulholland Drive is a Masterpiece.
TV Tropes was right. Trailers do spoil.

It is just so funny that the idiots who made this trailer thought it was a 
good idea to give away the biggest surprise of the whole movie.﻿
Is this the actual trailer from 2002 (I was about 8-9 years old in 2002 and 
have little memory of those days) ? because I think it would be unlikely 
that they would reveal Gandalf's resurrection in the trailer.  Correct me 
if i'm wrong ﻿
this still remains to be one of my favorite movies..i have the Trilogy 
which i never lend out..funny story..﻿
This movie was so good I had to rewind so many parts so see them over 
again.﻿
All-time best movies, and all-time best story. reread and re watch the 
series EVERY year!﻿
An awesome trailer for an awesome movie!!!﻿
I can't believe I waited a whole fucking year between these. Ugh, the 
agony. And now I can just pop 'em in, one after another. :)﻿
i cant wait for return of the king!!!!!! 12 years!!!!! They finally made a

i still dont get why 10000 uruks got defeated by at most, 200 men/elves...

To be honest,this is the best trailer i have ever seen.Even if i have seen 
TLOTR more than 20 times,i will watch it one more thanks to this trailer.
You got that right, thanks to those dick head amateur youtubers that love 
to over use it in fake sequel trailers just for the purpose of trolling.

that Gandalf would return :)

One thing I don't understand is why has society plunged into chaos just 
because we are no longer reproducing? Overpopulation is one of the reasons 
why everything is shit on this planet. We could do with a bit of 
infertility for about 10 years.﻿
I want too see this now lol. I have heard a lot of Alfonso. Seen the fthird

Illuminati doesnt want you to see this movie

GMO food,  FEMA - camps,...   This will happen people if we don't wake up﻿
This was an good movie but the thing is that why were they killing each 
other if they can't repoudce﻿
This is possibly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen, its rare to 
find a movie that gives you such a plethora of emotions. Clive Owen may not 
be the best actor in the world, but I actually can't imagine the movie 
being the same without him, if he just stuck to these kinds of movies 
(which is hard because there's not many this good) he'd be considered one 
of the best actors in the world. Shame he's just a one-trick pony though 
:( ﻿
a brilliant, smart look into the very near future by another Hispanic 
wunderkind, Alfonso Cuaron...﻿
This trailer doesn't do the cinematography or the acting any justice. Watch 
it!﻿
Great movie & story , great characters and i wish i had jaspers weed:)﻿
My favorite film of the 2000-2009 decade. It poses questions about war, 
race, aging, religion, death and the frailty of life.﻿
I love this film, Children of Men brought a unique story that I never 
conceived before, it did seem a bit farfetched at first but the film drew 
me in to where I began to wonder, well what if? Along with the great 
acting, dramatic scenes, suspense, action, and cinematography I found this 
movie to be greatly entertaining.﻿
i saw it on tv and it kept me from the first moment and the last 30 minutes 
were like when i first saw saving private ryan just a really sick movie 
give it a try﻿
If women are the infertile and assuming men are still fertile, can't we put 
human semen into a female ape which is closely related which would 
reproduce something of a neanderthal, a sentient but as highly intelligent 
being that we could teach to become smart.
I mean its plausible in some way﻿
What is this movie about, can someone please tell me because this movie 
looks cool.﻿
Such a touching a heart wrenching film... I just wish more people know 
about it! It deserves so much more notice than it received. ﻿
My favorite movie, it's just amazing,﻿

gotta love chicago ;)
I'm saying the trailer could have done much better in portraying how great 
the film was. The voice-over and editing ruin it
@LizDickey08 Lol i felt the same way when i watched Victor, Victoria it's 
with gays i loved it so much~
Musicals are so fun, they can be really dark but have little sparks of 
comedy or light-heartedness that blossom into spontaneous song. We need 
more musicals.
Well priceless Richard Gere gangster! Great Movie!
I disagree. The trailer is awesome. The movie is awesome. What's the 
problem?

This is the best movie/musical ever in human history and will always be. I

Wine movie : Sideways Trailer﻿
When my son was old enough for us to take road trips again, my wife and I 
visited a romantic restaurant that we hadn't been to in a while. I called 
ahead and when we arrived, I could see the fear in the maitre d's eyes 
because there were the two of us plus four tiny kids (my son, her older 
sister and two cousins of identical age). She put us in the corner and 
brought us water, two in wine glasses and four in plastic cups. I made her 
exchanged the plastics with breakables by assuring her that if I broke 
them, I could afford to pay for them. We had a great time and an old white 
couple actually came over and congratulated us on how surprisingly well 
behaved our Chinese kids were. The restaurant was Hitching Post in Buellton 
and the movie was Sideways.

10 Indie Films I like in no particular order:
#4 - Sideways﻿
As I was Googling information on wineries to visit with out-of-town 
friends, I discovered the movie, Sideways. So of course I downloaded it. It 
is a travel movie, my favorite, and it is also a romantic comedy, which is 
double coupons for me. The story is about a roadtrip with two college 
buddies, both in the 40's now. One was a has-been movie star who did mainly 
voice-over for TV commercials. The other was an aspiring author who 
couldn't get his book published and made his living as a high school 
teacher. He also happened to know a lot about wine. The movie star was 
getting ready to be married so he wanted one more fling. They drove from 
San Diego to Santa Barbara and both found the woman of their dream, 
although one turned out to be a nightmare.

I didn't see the movie. As if a woman could beat up a man anyway.
Best movie ever made of all time, and all that will ever be !!! Giamotti

I don't think this trailer was adequate for this movie.  This movie was far 
more a drama and romance than a comedy.  The tones and themes were 
melancholy and at times gave tingles of nostalgia to the audience due 
to......relativity.  Overall, this was a wonderful movie of originality and 
probably vastly overlooked sort of like "City of God".﻿
Kinda strange trailer, but guess its pretty difficult to make a trailer out 
of this movie.

Either way, if anyone is thinking about watching it - ignore the trailer 
and please do watch it! 

Both exciting and heartbreaking, beautifully captured and with a lot of 
intelligent messages. A true masterpiece!﻿
Watched this movie for the first time last night, began watching at 11:00so when it was over, it was difficult to get into "sleep mode" with so much

awesome. ﻿

Powerful movie, it leaves you thinking! This trailer does no justice for

Hey, folks! Since i realy like movies and have watched many over the years, 
i thought i could share my movie enthusiasm with you. So from now on, every 
friday will be #filmfriday and i will recommend a movie to you that i like 
and that i think you will enjoy watching. So enjoy watching it and feel 
free to post comments.

So the first movie i recommend to you is "Million Dollar Baby" (2004), 
directed by Clint Eastwood. Not only is it one of my favourite boxing 
movies, it s also one of my favourite Eastwood movies.
It s a classical underdog story with a very interessting and thought 
provoking story twist towards the end.

Have fun and see you next week!))﻿

This was the best film in the trilogy, followed by Batman Begins. I felt

we got 60 nukes FUCKING 60 if someone sends 1 nuke we bring it down and 
send 10 to them xD
please someone... tell me the melody's name at 1:30...!!! pleeeaase!!!
Why do you surprise? He's great
God bless, rather you than me !!!
that moment when the little girl answers the phone gives me the chills. 
fantastic movie
Nice try Hittler
shut the fuck up......
Daniel Craig is an israeli? LMFAO..
Anyone else confuse 1:17 Ciaran Hinds with Geoffrey Rush 1:05 watching the

I like proclaiming things as certainty too that I do not know! All hail 
Sparticus!
Don't go there... 
ooooooh 60, so fucking what. I'm sure they don't just have 1 nuke laying 
around and no more. Fact is there aren't many defence protocols for a 
nuclear attack in a third world Country, it's just a fact. If you were to 
send over nukes to the US, not only would they be able to shoot them down 
(ie massive air force), but they would send nukes, atom bombs, hydrogen 
bombs, napalm, cluster bombs etc etc. If the US really wanted you gone, it 
would have happened long ago. I don't like teh US, just facts
im gonna watch this !

one of the best Spielberg's movies
after this movie i hates they all ...

What an ironic movie.  The movie portrays the Nazi's as dignified human 
beings, and portray the Jews as barbarians.  Kind of the opposite of what 
the movie was trying to portray, or was it?﻿
That smirk the Bear Jew makes imagining the evil he will get to do soon 
gets me everytime. ﻿
0:32 is he from The office?﻿
Looks like American piece of crap.. at least for  us europeans..﻿
0:31 nice and clean﻿
fucken one of the worst war movies I've ever scene and probably the biggest 
let down when it comes to movies.﻿
1:00 Quentin you did it wrong. That sign is a swastika. The nazi sign is 
45° rotated, right facing. It pisses me off if I see mistakes like that.
Damn you Hitler, polluting everything he reached with his dirty fingers!﻿
fucking loved this movie.﻿
they made this movie look too much like the expendables in this 
trailer..... which it was not. still great though﻿
"the weinstein company"

heuheu﻿
 Some people think that this method of war is efficient. It's completely 
wrong, methods like this have been proven by all to be very inefficient, 
that's right, by every single regime or power that ever applied them, it 
ended badly. Methods like this only strengthen the opposing power because 
they can use the evidence to show how violent and uncivilized the 
persecutors are. 

This is one of the reasons I don't like this movie, even the allies knew 
this and they never went through with it.﻿
masterpiece﻿
This trailer is almost like one of those parody recut trailers where they 
make Mary Poppins look like a horror or The Shining look like a family 
movie... This trailer blatantly lies and makes the movie look like 
something it's not. The main character of Inglorious Basterds was Shosanna 
and she's only glimpsed once for about half a second in the whole trailer. ﻿
The Jews are a race of cowardly, lying, murderous parasites. The more I 
learn about them, the more I learn to love every non Jewish race. To much 
blind hatred is being targeted at the wrong people in this world, while the 
only group of people that deserve our hatred is treated like gods﻿
Worst war movie ever, and don't give this BS about how it got good reviews 
and shit, I fucking hated it.﻿
this movie is absolute garbage﻿
When jew smashes skull of a random German guy thats OK.
This film is bullshit and full of hatred, not only towards nazis but also 
to all Germans.﻿
Better than Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. ﻿
Worst war movie I have ever scene. The trailer lied to us and it was a huge 
let down, even for Quentin Tarantino.﻿
A lot of deleted scenes in this trailer¡¡﻿

this trailer is extremely misleading! if you want brad pitt and awesome

french and isn't good for sleepovers (from experience) ﻿

This is such a good and depressing movie! I just remembered it and I think 
that absolutely everyone should watch this.The trailer isn't very good but 
I promise you it's such a good movie! So basically, it's about this guy who 
is setting out to find the guy who killed his wife, but his mind is unable 
to store new memories, and they all go away after a few minutes. The last 
thing he remembers is the night that the man broke into his house, killing 
his wife and giving him the injury that took away his memory. He writes 
things on sticky notes and tattoos to put together the pieces to find the 
man. All the scenes are backwards, so you see what he does at the end, then 
go backwards and see what happened before. But, there are some unexpected 
things, and the ending just leaves you feeling rather sad.﻿

#Cineycafe “Hable con Ella” – Pedro Almodóvar.﻿
Ladies and Gentlemen....some Pedro Almodovar! ﻿
@TheAmemart buscala en cuevana . tv 
Me encanta tantooo *--*
De hecho, la peli es maravillosa, la recomiendo para todos los estudiantes 
de E/LE, enseña aspectos culturales y éticos. SALU2 DESDE BRASIL!
No guy has ever figured out women like Almodovar! Genius. I like all his 
movies, but I think this one is the BEST. 
Una pena que en esta película se hayan matado 6 toros para el rodaje de un 
par de escenas completamente prescindibles. Dejó de ser mi película 
favorita de Almodóvar cuando me enteré de ésto y Almodóvar, para mi, dejó 
de ser lo que era.
esta pelı es buenısımaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Just watch this movie I loved it very complex 
me ton almodovar ginesai kalyteros anthrwpos....
wow i didnt know karl pilkington could speak spannish.......... :)
my favorite is la male educacion !! Great movie!! 
I'm not into Almodovar's movies, but this one is a work of art!

Best Harry Potter movie ever, yup ! 👌﻿
please... please can someone of you explain to me why you think this is the 
best HP film??﻿
Best Potter film after DH Part II and third best novel in my opinion. The 
film just beats Goblet of Fire because the GoF movie missed out Ludo 
Bagman,the World Cup and Crouch's death was obvious.﻿
Its book is the best among Harry Potter books.﻿
This is my least favourite Harry Potter Filmbecause it adds in a lot of 
unneeded material such as extra characters (like Pike) who aren't in any of 
the others and other random add ins that just confused me when I tried to 
watch it.﻿
My favorite Harry Potter movie!﻿
From 00: at 0:20 just the best with Malfoy who looks Hermione :p﻿
1:40 oh shit ﻿
I want to see this :) ﻿

I remember watching this trailer everyday online as a kid wanting to see 
this film so bad. I got chills at 1:03.﻿
I m 22 and i actually love this movie.It is normal?
My favorite Harry Potter book and movie! :-) The movie was really different 
from the book but hey, its Hollywood. ;-P
After this movie no other Harry potter is good (except deathly hallows part 
2)
Best Harry Potter film!!!!!!
I get your point. No problem :) Just wanted to make sure you knew HP is 
british
"Turn to page 394" OH SHIT.
Overall I meant the movie was different from the book due to the inability 
to present certain aspects of the story onscreen in a comprehensive manner, 
and the need for thematic screenplay. Using "Hollywood" in my comment was a 
reference to the movie industry as a whole, regardless where it is based. 
Though perhaps it was unwise of me to use an Americanism on a British film, 
and for that I apologize.

320p.... is not HQ. Amazing movie though ﻿
this movie is a masterpiece﻿
amazing movie﻿
oh my god i love this movie. 
Learning about the depression in my class right now and we watched this it 
is now one of my favorite movies.
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. It is a true story of 
incredible hope and faith about how much a man loves his family and will 
sacrifice everything to provide for them. This is a positive and 
inspirational movie that was not nominated for best picture. Look at the 
acadamy award nominations for 2005 and draw your own opinions. I will never 
watch the acadamy awards. Hollywood should be ashamed. 
The epic finale against the giant champ Primo Carnera means even more when 
you see the real Carnero. He starred in "Hercules Unchained," his last 
movie role as a Greek giant fighting movie muscleman Steve Reeves, who was 
the biggest hero in movies at the time--and Carnero dwarfs him! See how big 
and menacing Carnero really was. The movie can be viewed at Flixhouse (dot) 
com for free.
Could someone please tell me, what is the name of the song at 1:48- 2:20?
Definitely one of the best 10 movies ever made.
another RUSSELL CROWE RON HOWARD COLLABERATION also PAUL GIAMATI looks great
Why did he fight? For milk. Yes, he did fight for his country. He fought so 
everyone could have milk.
Without a doubt the greatest movie ever.
@schuf1 I know, this should've cleaned house with Oscars. Amazing movie.
The word determination just doesn't cover it. So many people are down now. 
So many guys are just looking for an opportunity. 
@schuf1 is so deserved an award, unfortunately its hard to get awards when 
your movie has real truth and beauty in it though. This movie changed my 
life
I saw this in my class, its the best movie i've ever seen, the whole class 
was cheering on for jimmy. it was awsome.
This film..you need to watch it just after watching never back down.
Such a movie beast movie

until reading Orchid Thief. The orchid guy is about what I envisioned when 
reading it. AWESOME.
Interesting story, make sense, Donald is obssees with the language of 
orchids, Charlie help his brother in long fight over Orchid Story, Donald 
played by Cage beautifully, who is following in his brother's footsteps as 
a screenwriter, moves in with him. Donald risk his life to get the 
screenplay in the process, the movie won three other nominations , Best 
Actor Cage and Actress Streep

*Sony Pictures Acquiring Rights to a Movie About Steve Jobs?*
There is only one movie about the life of Steve Jobs I would love to see, 
and it is made by *Pixar*, the animation company Steve Jobs bought from 
George Lucas back in the day. I really hope Pixar will do that in the near 
future. There are powerful lessons to be learned from the life of Steve 
Jobs -- a Pixar movie would appeal to and inspire both kids & adults alike. 

*What do you think?*

I attached a trailer of Pixar's last true masterpiece, UP!﻿
Only Disney/Pixar films can reduce people (including grown men) to tears! 
they practically had me bawling by the end of the movie! There has to be 
something wrong with your tearducts if you dont feel a little teary eyed by

i cried so many times. this is an amazing movie. the beginning killed me.

"Price & Prejudice" this is my favorite movie based on a book, i like

had yhe book for long time but i have had the movie for tree years.
