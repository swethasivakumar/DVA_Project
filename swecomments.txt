This was the best film in the trilogy, followed by Batman Begins. I felt 
that Dark Knight Rises was a let down as I was expecting something to rival 
Dark Knight. There was too many plot holes in the final film. Heath Ledger 
played the Joker better than anyone could have ever wished.Ôªø
great actor,no one will be like him..heath ledgerÔªø
Great movie

Ôªø
EPIC MovieÔªø

The Amazing Spider Man 2 - Official Final Trailer Extended Look | 2014 [HQ]Ôªø
Weird that "we have you under surveillance" part wasn't in the film 
Ôªø
For people saying they feel like they saw the whole film based on this 
trailer:

A great portion of the scenes in this trailer were cut from the final 
film. Ôªø
I watched the movie last night. best. movie. ever! Also I know this is 
strange but I have to admit that Harry is actually kinda cute in this movieÔªø
Godzilla still is a better trailer than this and TransformersÔªø
This is not a trailer... this is the whole film in a fast paced version!Ôªø
great electro man rhino and green goblin when i saw captain america winter 
soldier i saw trailer for this and electro man said green goblin! who else 
agrees????Ôªø
I swear i just watched the whole movie on this trailer, all the good parts 
any way! P.s the end was kinda like wtf. Ôªø
Whats Harry thinking/looking at @ 2:56?Ôªø

spiderman.  Ôªø
Seen it yesterday great movie :DÔªø
Hi guys i made a Quick movie review on The Amazing Spider-man 2 Please 
check it out. Thank YouÔªø
Well, Spidy.........I think is the good time you call TMNT or the Avengers 
for help........Ôªø
And so does this...Ôªø
As Much I enjoyed Tobey, Andrew is alright, I hope they don't overdue it 
like they did Spiderman-3 ...then we'll be looking at another reboot.
this seems to be like too much going on for a 2nd movie.Ôªø
I lost my shit when he talked about washing the American flag, no joke XDÔªø
I don't care, Andrew is hot, I'm going to watch itÔªø
hated the first movie.. i missed Tobey all the time, let's see how this one 
holds up.. If Gwen Staci doesn't die I'm asking for a refund... They need 
to keep that part of the canon.Ôªø
Hell yea im watchin this on BluRayÔªø
DON'T READ THE COMMENTS if you care about spoilers SOMEONE HAS SPOILED THE 
ENTIRE FILM WITH NO WARNINGÔªø
Everyone is telling people to go to watch these now . Com IS IT LEGAL!? I 
know it's probably not but is it safe!?Ôªø
1:31 creepy music.Ôªø
Just saw this today, but I hate watching the trailer before actually seeing 
the movie. Too many spoilers!!Ôªø
Finally an enemy with dubstep powers...Ôªø
$$$$
It's definitely not clobbering time for this movie. But these trailers are 
awesome! Too bad the movies aren't really.Ôªø
What an awful movie that wasÔªø
The reason why Jessica Alba like her bf so much because he has the biggest 
penis in the world. HahaÔªø
Chris Evans is like a legend to Marvel movies. Wonder how hard it is to 
change personalities like that <3Ôªø
I love the Captain <3... I know... in this movie he¬¥s not captain america 
but for me he always will be <3 <3 Ôªø
Captain?Ôªø

captain ??
Maria menounus!
muchas gracias por la subida.
if ur talking about him being dead in the comics he's not any more
Still the best superheroes movie
should have been good, chris evans was great, better than his steve rogers 
as was michael chilikis. jessica alba was dreadfully miscast. lots of stuff 
went wrong with this movie which is a shame
its hard to beleive that the captain america was like that ! XD
Anyone i meant
RIP Johnny Storm
Horrible movie. 
awesome movie
Now, I can't exactly remember on how good this movie was, as I saw it when 
I was fairly young. After watching the 1994 movie, however, I can safely 
say this is the better version.
Johnny *-*

It's such a shame that Harry Potter had ended. I think it ended in the

they were so cute!Ôªø
The trailers get so much darker over the yearsÔªø

I remember when I first saw this movie I was looking for John Travolta the 
whole time... and then.. .-.
where
my fav movie <3 <3 <3 
omg when zac winks
Is that John Travolta???!!! Wow, I thought I halucinated... Great job.
i love this film..... it makes me twist XD
You know he beat Hugh Jackman or Wolverine himself for the role of Corny 
Collins, that just makes me laugh XD
>:( WOW this is soooo different from grease, grease is mostley about a love 
story. HAIRSPRAY takes place a DECADE! later and is about fitting in when 
your different and that no matter how much you weigh ir what your skin 
color is you can do whatever you want! so you knwo what its not "Grease 
rip-off"
@MySunShines13 why? can you or anyone explain this commnet please? why is 
it awkward for them?
◊°◊®◊ò ◊û◊î◊û◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù◊ù<3
I miss amanda bynes <3
this movie is awesome 
i knew Britanny Snow before Pitch Perfect; she's awesome in both Hairspary 
and Pitch Perfect! :D
The awkward moment when you first realize Mrs. Turnblad is really John 
Travolta ._.

Guys guys...guess what..!!
This movie was taylor swift's favorite!!!Ôªø
this is a good Christmas movie to watch with your significant other. Very 
underrated movieÔªø
I could watch this everyday !!! :)


Love Actually.Ôªø
How could they have stopped listing the amazing cast there!!!??Ôªø
During this time of the year we can‚Äôt get enough of Christmas movies on TV. 
What‚Äôs your favourite? 

We‚Äôll be watching Love Actually tonight!Ôªø
Not enough RickÔªø
I LOVE THIS MOVIE! MAKES ME HAPPY ALL THE TIME:))Ôªø
The prime minister tale is my favorite of the film<3Ôªø
That moment you discover that Rick fucking Grimes was trying to date 
Elizabeth Swan in this movie!! XD XDÔªø
SNAPE?! Ôªø
Am I wrong, or did I just see Rick Grimes from the Walking Dead in this 
trailer?! :o check it out at  1:06 - 1:07 Ôªø
Love Actually (2003) - Official TrailerÔªø
Rick Grimes before he met Lory? Haha oh man my jokes suck.Ôªø
all i want for christmas is Keira KnightlyÔªø
Way to go, racist Hollywood. Conveniently leaving Chiwetal Ejiofor  out of 
the trailer.Ôªø
I love Rom-Coms but I have never seen this movieÔªø
Snape Snape Severus Snape...!Ôªø
Gay...Ôªø
Martin, Alan, Liam, I NEED TO WATCH THIS ASAP.Ôªø
Aww... I want to watch this movie again. With my girlfriend (but i hasn't 
found her yet) :(Ôªø
Rick Grimes! ahahÔªø
Watch this with a girl to get laid. Thank me later.Ôªø
IS THAT FUCKING RICK GRIMES?!Ôªø
not sure if its because everyone keeps mentioning it so I thought I watched 
it or I actually watched it and just forgot it...Ôªø
I watched this because of Hugh Grant :)Ôªø
$$$$
Has to be one of my favorite movies!! Ôªø
Can somebody help me...Is Bruce Wayne's father a doctor or OWNER of Wayne 
Enterprises????????????Ôªø
Man... for some reason this was my favorite batman movie of the Nolan 
trilogy, which of course the other two were good, no denying that but this 
one... i think just how the story unfolded and how everything was put 
together was pretty impressive in my opinion. Batman Begins takes the 
trophy. :DÔªø
Anyone else hate how scarecrow was stopped?Ôªø
Bale is the best batman ever!!Ôªø
Definitely my favorite batman movie. Before this one, every time when I saw 
batman on screen, I was just like "ok...he is a man who kicks others' ass", 
but this one show me much more about this hero, something deeply in side 
this man.Ôªø
If that thief had never killed Bruce's parents then he would have grown up 
normally and he never would have become Batman, without batman Gotham 
would've been fucked. In a way, the thief is the real hero here! Ôªø
Best to worst 

1. Batman Begins
2. The Dark Knight
3. The Dark Knight rising (borefest)Ôªø
says he will not become an executioner...kills every member of the league 
of shadows Ôªø
I didn't like the third one. To many characters and after Ledger died they 
were pretty much done with this version. Sad because I know the battles 
between Bat Man and the Joker were just heating up. I also liked the first 
two made about a decade before. It was a different style, more fantasy like 
I think, but cool.Ôªø
"I am not going to kill you, but I won't have to save you" Epic! The best 
of the trilogy!Ôªø
i cant believe i still havent seen this movie and batman is like my 
favourite hero. i need to go out and get the dvdÔªø
One of the best films ive ever seen Bale was awesome as Bruce Wayne/Batman
 Ôªø
If you watch Batman Begins backwards, it's about a lunatic who prances 
around in a bat suit until he's cured by being trapped in a well with 
hundreds of bats.Ôªø
When does this come out?!Ôªø
Ah, Christopher Nolan, the man who turned what was gothic superhero fun 
into dreary, overwrought Shakespearean-style melodrama. And Christian Bale, 
who created the most unintentionally bad and hilarious Batman of all time 
that it made Adam West's portrayal look Oscar-winning.Ôªø
good luck at beating that Afflek!Ôªø
one of my favorite movies of all time!!!Ôªø
Only a cynical man would call what these people 
have "lives," ...Crime,despair... this is not how man was supposed to 
live. (to people hate the dark knight trilogy)Ôªø
love the first movie
love the second
love the thirdÔªø
What's with all the crap on the screen? NEXT!Ôªø
Everyone saying really rude things about The Dark Knight Rises needs to 
have a little more respect for the film. It's a trilogy and it needed to be 
concluded. It came in three parts, to bring together one whole trilogy. I 
understand if people don't like it, but saying it was "so boring" and "too 
long" is very off considering it was a wrap up that had a lot to wrap up. 
It was meant to dig deeper into the character of Bruce/Batman, not just be 
all action and fighting. It had raw emotion and character depth, which was 
what it was going for. I feel like they did that well, plus they had some 
nice fight scenes added. Plot holes of course, but honestly what comic 
adaptation doesn't have them? It was a long story to wrap up and they 
weren't given much time to add everything to the movie without going over 
their time limits, so I feel they did really well. If you don't like it 
that's 100 percent okay, everyone likes different things and I totally see 
how people could be turned off by some of the plot holes, but don't lash 
out on it so much for silly reasons like it didn't have enough "action". It 
was actually a really raw and amazing film that concluded the rest very 
well. Ôªø
Batman Begins and The Dark Knight were amazing movies. The Dark Knight 
Rises was just plain awful though. So many plot holes, so many mistakes. 
Brilliant casting, but executed poorly with a very rushed script.Ôªø
  That guy dressed up like a bat, clearly has issues :XDÔªø
Not many people can pull off 3 great movies in a row. Christopher Nolan 
managed to thoughÔªø
$$$$
stop comparing HARRY POTTER with this stupid love story.. and don't say i'm 
another hater that didn't watch the film.. i watched the first one and 
switched it off before the end it's soo boring.. it literally is a waste of 
time ..and twilight is nothing infront of harry potter.. didn't even sell 
HALF of what harry potter soldÔªø
so this movie never won harry potter and will never win it :)Ôªø
HEY LOOK, IT'S COUNT-COCK-CULA!Ôªø
kristen stewart having emotions? Really?Ôªø
I demand a shot-for-shot remake of the first Twilight movie, with all the 
same actors.

Except Robert Pattinson. The role of Edward Cullen shall be performed by 
Danny DeVito.Ôªø
OMG I LOVE TWILIGHT
--no sane person everÔªø
I wanna see bloopers of this series, how can any of these actors say these 
corny ass/terrible lines without laughing. lmao These movies are so 
badddddd that I love them. The acting, the writing, the characters(you dont 
care about any of them, and theyre not believable), animation, etc etc. idk 
how chicks could think this is good lolÔªø
most people that hate twilight haven't even seen the movies..they just 
listen to other haters and cause of the''monkey see monkey do'' fact they 
become just another mindless hater...the movie is very good..i didn't liked 
the New Moon that much and took me a while before watching the rest of the 
saga...i saw breaking dawn part 1 in the army before a year(i served 
special forces as a paratrooper btw)and that night we were like 50-60 guys 
watching it and everyone liked it,even guys that made fun of it in the 
beginning..anyway my point is that people hate this movie mostly for no 
reason,or because it's cool making fun of it because some other idiots 
do,or just because they want to be ''that'' guy...Ôªø
Vampire love... give me a brake... Underwold was even good movie with 
vampires. Something like Van Helsing mixed with Blade. But please don't 
tell me Twilight is a good movie. I don't like this kind of silly movies... 
Divergent, Twilight, Hungry Games (this is better title)... no comment.Ôªø
The books are better then the move!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
You cannot compare harry potter with twilight EVERÔªø
everytime I Watch twilight I get so much emotions I think this is a very 
very good movieÔªø
Maleficent? Can anyone confirm that beginning.Ôªø
None
+Blarghalt @BlarghaltI mean DevitoÔªø
Simply, I love this movie forever3Ôªø
Now while i love me some twilight(im watching it now on dvd)...this could 
never be better than Harry Potter!!!Ôªø
Better love story then Twi- Oh wait.....Ôªø
Here's a question, what will be edwards reaction when bella hit her 
menstruation cycle ??Ôªø
The fact that she thinks TWILIGHT may threaten the HP movies.. pffft rightÔªø
Love Twilight <3Ôªø
Harry potter = awesome  Vampires = awesome...... they're both special films 
i their own ways... :) So don;t judge!Ôªø
Still better than Phillip Seymour Hoffman. I digriget Hoffman.

Leo was creepy good in this movie. Scorsese really brings something out in 
his actors!Ôªø
cÔªø
Martin Scorsese is the GOAT.Ôªø
only scorsese can make a movie that would be better than the trailer 
suggests...Ôªø
inspired by the mob boss james "whitey" bulgar from boston google winter

11 ppl drug king pin n extortion. Damn boston!!!! n here i thought boston 
was lame n corny lmao dat must jus b the hockey team go blackhawksÔªø
My top 10 of all time Ôªø
This was the last movie Leo looked young in, he couldn't play a kid in 
anything after this anymore! I remember him playing a kid or really young 
guy all the time lol. After this he bulked up and has grown into a fine 
young man. I thought he would look young forever! lolÔªø
good movie, good soundtrack. ending is abit randomÔªø
Best Movie Ever!!!Ôªø
Infernal Affairs is way better.Ôªø
this is a movie, 10/10 the true masterpiece!, a martin scorsese classic 
movie!
not a garbage of a chinese or japanese infernal affairs shit... , Ôªø
they definitely need to make a sequel Ôªø
I love this movieÔªø
Read the description. The fact that a mole is inside the state police isn't 
a huge secret in the movie... 
I didn't think I would like this movie at all. Turns out I LOVED it! It's 
so well done.
it was the envelope he had on his desk that read citizens. 
Oh shit, Matt Damon And Marky Mark Wahlberg! Greatest movie ever. - Comic

Amazing movie, but this trailer is just awful. This makes the movie look 
like a kiddie comedy, when in reality is pretty much the same style as 
Disney's previous musicals. It's misleading and stupid, same goes for the 
marketing they made with Frozen. (No, I haven't seen Frozen, but I've heard 
that's amazing and I really want to see it, but I don't like the 
commercials)Ôªø
why do they always put scenes in trailers that aren't in the movie?Ôªø
Frozen is shit compared to Tangled.

Just saying. My reasons behind this are that Pascal is a much better 
companion to have than Olaf as he tries to steal the glory from the main 
roles.Ôªø
This is my biography for real lol!:-) Ôªø
so weird

Ahhh I hate sandra Bullock..Ôªø
Loved this movie... caught me off guard because I didn't go in expecting 
much. Best movie I've seen in a while.

I think the song Pompeii would've been the perfect song for this movie.Ôªø
Even the trailer makes me cry and I don't cry much in moviesÔªø

misuse of public office is now a epidemic, wake up people , incitement of

politically motivated wording is untruth , how far do you want it to go ? I

Trailer doesn't really explain what it's about.... I guess i'll google the 
storyline before deciding whether to watch it or notÔªø
get some grasp on the real world on WWW.INFOWARS.COM
this movie is one of many Hollywood attacks on the ideas of LIBERTYÔªø
This is my favorite superhero movie ever. It's kind of the opposite of the 
Avengers and 29038930 times more badass.Ôªø
can anyone tell me the name of that song and the singer who is singing it?Ôªø
Can you believe that it was tanks to this trailer that I read the book. And 
It was my best moment in my life reading the book! Ôªø
If you love this movie, and haven't read the book.
You should fucking read it. One of the best things that D.C has published. 
  Ôªø
All the fanbitches got over hyped and end up disappointed saying "uuuh 
worst movie ever", what did you expect building  it up so high? Great movie 
& novel Ôªø
My video isn't workingÔªø
Who else came here from El-Cid?Ôªø
Lordy. That ending with that...thingamajig coming out of the ground reminds 
me of this freaky nightmare I had when I was a kid. ._. Anyway. I wanna 
watch this now. Ôªø
best movie everÔªø
I remember the hype for this movie. Never read the novel but i honestly 
thought that the trailer is much better than the movie. I got confused and 
slept through some parts.Ôªø
man this trailer takes me back. it got me so pumped. this is still 
underrated. smh.Ôªø
This was the worst movie everÔªø
Bad match of song for the trailer. The tone is all different from the 
actual movie. There you have music from the 60s, here you have music from 
some punk blokes. Watchmen is the best superhero film in recent years 
because it's so different tonally, so dark and sticks true to the comic. 
Bale's Batman is good too, just a different sort of goodÔªø
from the director of 300, i passÔªø
"And the world will look up and shout save us!! and I will whisper NO!!"Ôªø
I never watched this because V for Vendetta was lacking.Ôªø
Can anyone give me a basic explanation on what this movie is about?Ôªø
My favorit trailer of all time!Ôªø
This movie looks great can't wait for it to come out.Ôªø
The Watchmen exist, in some dimension, and have weaved their way into our 
history. Nixon has been re-elected four times, Dr. Manhattan guards against 
the mad, nuclear-armed Soviets and Rorschach wears his mask in defiance of 
the law. Sear them into your mind then find and enjoy this great movie.Ôªø
I'm glad they tried, but I don't think I would ever be satisfied with any 
adaptation of the comic. It's too complex and restricted to the specific 
medium of comics (as Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons explained), but they 
certainly gave it their best shot. Nothing more you can ask for, I guess.
I absolutely loved this movie.
Haha
$$$$
So this movie was released in 2000, but someone told me it was made WAY 
before that.  Is it true?  (I couldn't find it online; all I could find was 
the release date.)Ôªø
My my...we certainly take our high school football seriously in the US.Ôªø
Looks like pretty good movieüèàÔªø

Cry every time, soooo good. And I dont even understand football. Im just in

Basketball: *Coach Carter* for sureÔªø
Awesome movie...watching it right now...so sad I need to go to workÔªø
Yeah totally agree, Im South African and i can relate obviously because of 
Apartheid and shiz. But yeah I got goosebumps through out the movie. One of 
the greatest movies of all time. 
go robinson rams!
BEST MOVIE EVEEERRR ! 
Yay I got to see the trailer :)
GREAT STUFF
I said the same thing about THE LONE RANGER
Great film, Terrible trailer. completely avoids any mention of racism. 
I love the description.
1:01, who is that actor?
Were the Titans often the underdogs, as the film implies? No. In fact, by 
the end of the 1971 season (including playoffs) the T.C. Williams Titans 
were 13-0 and ranked second in the nation. They dominated almost every game 
that they played, shutting out their opponents in nine of their thirteen 
games and outscoring them by a margin of 338-38. The championship game was 
a blowout as well, unlike what we see in the film. Below is the Titans 1971 
schedule showing the scores of each game. 
I watched this movie a thousand times !! Even though this movie is way too 
much emotions I can handle haa.. We all need lessons like the ones they 
get. It is a great movie filled with a lot of humor and real tragedy, and I 
never get tired of it. Btw Denzel Washington makes every movie absolutely 
amazing !
this is my favorite movie ever
I soo agree! :D
dude the movie is made to show the ivercoming of adversity not whether it 
is exactly like history dude
whats the song at 0:45?
$$$$
this, and Kingdom of Heaven, are two of the best movies ever! (IMO)Ôªø
The original film had very good music which suited the scenes very well - 
shame the directors cut wasnt the sameÔªø
TROYÔªø

what happend to my beloved legolas??......
What's the name of the song @ 1:00
I'm getting the collector's edition. I want the freebies. :) Down with

Troja (german word 4 Troy) means also bitch in Italy O-o
if you are a devout christian ( i am ) you would not wish or pray that

My eyes, my eyes! The quality is just too beautiful For my mortal eyes to 
see !!
@mirage2000ize katarxas eimai gynaika alla fisika greece 4ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!
brilliant film :D
I don't think is doubting that the city actually existed. It is the stories 
that revolve around mythological characters and Gods which are hardly 
believable. I mean you can take any period of ancient or medieval history 
and most of the places and characters existed, but the stories are often 
fictionalized, mytholized and retold from generation to generation. Look at 
the depictions of Jesus Christ or even King Richard. 
hector should have won the battle 
I agree
this is one of my fave movies of all time!
So, anyone know the music this trailer is set to? I can't seem to find 
anything on the song or who made it.
@Bellafoxie Ya but who needs him wen you have eric bana in troy aswell!!!! 
:) 
The worst depiction of history ever. The Iliad describes Hektor as diving 
barefoot into fighting warriors on horseback. "An invincible headlong 
terror. Maniacal". When I look at Eric bana in Troy all I see is a 
metrosexual Hollywood prettyboy performing theater stage combat level III. 
And where is the monolithic Rage of Akhilleus? Although I'm only a martial 
artist I "know" I can take on this prettyboy portrayal of Akhilleus and 
Hektor simultaneously, and I'm a nobody. Read the damn Iliad once.
TROY>3OO
the fight between Achilles and Hector the most epic!
One movie where Sean Bean lives, but then he had to go through 10 years 
after the war sailing and shxt...
Is this what you left me for!? awesome movie
ERIC BANA IS THE BEST 
$$$$
beautiful pictureÔªø
Why is Stanley Tucci so goddamn talented!! (:Ôªø
this is my favorite movie ever  made me cry every scene... its like true to

not a well known movie but still awesome
its in my top 50Ôªø
I swear in the movie Susie is reading "seventeen" not "Vouge" at 0:07 
the best movie i've watched in the last 10 years. 
it is.. made me cry sooo much 
the song is called ‚ÄòAlice‚Äô by the Cocteau twins. Your welcome! 
fag, without feelings.
@morphix66 in the book he tried so hard to find her killer and how he 
builds ships in the bottles with her. he just seems awesome to me idk why 
you're questioning me
I agree :)....same here
until i heard "i was murdered." i was like oh this is going to be a normal 
love stor-"until i was murdered" 0_0
Beautiful movie <3
@GreekNastyBoy - STFU -.-t This Movie Is Great
@magicalstrings1 I haven't seen the movie yet, but Susie was raped and 
murdered, her body mutilated and locked in a safe. It's a brilliant novel, 
I highly recommend it :)
im reading the book.
Best move My favourite film anyways
I'm reading the book
I was told I look like the girl that plays Susie, and now that I got 
contacts, I really see it, other than the fact I have brown hair!
Best movie,but reminds me of my sister... R.I.P brandy luv ya
great mooving movie!!!!!
If you saw the movie, I hope you read the book. I've never cried so much 
about a novel.
@neva0say0die I agree i love this song..When you watch this movie ,,The 
song makes u cry in it If i find it ill be sure to message u
Best. Movie. Ever. I read the book, I loved it too. Amazing.

This looks really good!!!  But as always.. Im sure this story will be 
nothing like the comic book itself...I'm sure any xmen comic puris will be 
complaning about "actual comic event" vs "movie events" but none the less 
just to see and actual comic event come to life is great!!  I would love to 
see the "Brood" story come to life in the big screen.Ôªø

The movie was AWESOME!!!!!!Ôªø
Avatar 2: Releasing 2015. Plot synopsis: The RDA, unbound by the Outer 
Space Treaty signed two centuries earlier, returns to Pandora and bombards 
the surface from orbit with nuclear, antimatter, and kinetic weapons. Or 
maybe Chemical or Biological. Whatever. The entire planet suffers a mass 
extinction, and mining teams in Hazmat suits mine the unobtanium. Done. Too 
expensive? Well Unobtanium happens to sell for 20 million a kilo and they 
have it all. Yay. Go Humans!Ôªø
suck movieÔªø
i can't believe 4 years have passed!Ôªø
It proves more money doesn't necessarily make a good movie :(Ôªø
Look people, you can deny for all you want, but the facts don't lie. Over 
2.7 BILLIONS made at the box office means a great load of people loved the 
movie! I'm sorry it didn't have that ''Avatar'' feeling on you, but I've 
experienced it and it was amazing! I didn't have any expectations 
whatsoever and I think it paid a lot.

The plot is not that complicated, but the detailed world and the dynamic of 
the movie was incredible. Not once did I noticed the computer generated 
animations that were the Navi's, maybe because I suspended my disbelief for 
three hours.

I really don't understand some critics saying the story lacked complexity 
while critics are covering with gold the ''Gravity'' movie which has less 
story developpment. It's like a hero, some people like to bring him down. 
''Avatar'' was exceptionnal, period.Ôªø
A very entertaining movie.

It marked a turning point in the year 2009, when we had finally kicked out 
Bush Jr, and sworn in Obama. Dubya and Cheney left the political scene with 
their hotly opposed wars and subsequent major economic collapse, this movie 
makes a nice response to the obscene orgy of war violence aka The War On 
Terror and it's darkness that gripped the world's attention for the better 
part of the 2000s...Ôªø
In the history of Hollywood movies, one of the best and costly movie is

{James Cameron-AVATAR}
They have used $237 million and they have earn $2,782,275,172.Ôªø
I still haven't seen Avatar. I think I was just turned off by the whole 
hyped up 3D thing, so I had negative associations with this movie. Just 
came across this trailer and now it's high on my list. Might try and watch 
it this weekend.Ôªø
Just in case‚Ä¶ ;-)Ôªø
I just love it!Ôªø
Aw man that was a waste of 10 bucks at the theater! , , , Could've just 
watched this trailerÔªø
boringÔªø
is it a culture spear darli!a very good morning,sadÔªø
I love this trailer but when I saw the complete movie it wasn't that 
amazing.
Not today, but this type of story has been done so many times. It's nothing 
groundbreaking is what the guy probably tried to say. The story is not very 
original. 
Best Movie !!!
Still, nothing of this scale had been done to that point.
How is this unoriginal?
What is this soundtrack?? Please,answer.
From what. The regurgitation of the american film industry. Or the fact 
that movie studios are to scared to put money into something new so they 
churn over the same crap for a new generation. Tell me....... 
$$$$
Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swearÔªø
This film was so amazing, watched it in the cinema in 3D then on BluRay at 
home. The end gets me every time. I'm about to watch it again tomorrow. I 
can't wait to watch it with my GF for the first time, she is amazing when 
watching films (she's always amazing) because she can get really into a 
film and be really emotional about what's happening so I can't wait for her 
reaction to this :')

Btw. This trailer is mindblowing, gets me the watery eyesÔªø
people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to 
remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.Ôªø
I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. Ôªø
Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ Ôªø
What is the name of the music?Ôªø
Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?Ôªø
It's kind of funny how J.J.Abrams worked on star wars to, (star trek, Star 
wars). Someone has a thing for stars lol.Ôªø
The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict 
Cumberbatch <3Ôªø
Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR 
masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered 
Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the 
thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other 
over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees 
when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who 
knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the 
established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at 
the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW 
that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of 
his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been 
bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high 
school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the 
views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a 
multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of 
the franchise.Ôªø
I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches Ôªø
people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'Ôªø
Benny!!! <3Ôªø
Very good movieÔªø
I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice Ôªø
One of the best of 2013 gotta love J.J Ôªø
IT'S A TRAP.....Oh wait, wrong movie!Ôªø
They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.Ôªø
I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes 
Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... Ôªø
I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for meÔªø
two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!Ôªø
tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of 
Benedict Cumberbatch ‚ô•.Ôªø
Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is 
released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how 
the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first 
came out! Ôªø
The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and 
directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 
90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the 
Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to 
the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and 
when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately 
egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he 
is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty 
Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds 
worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if 
he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly 
good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star 
Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a 
shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the 
feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you 
know,the heart of the Mythos.Ôªø
You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.Ôªø

yeah yeah i remember! :)
Best film indeed, Frank.
Isn't it sad that you have to reply to yourself?

Film trailers just aren't nearly as good today as they used to be.
No. Best is Eyes Wide Shut by Kubrick. But this film comes next... greets
No need to apologies bro, its you opinion :P and your right it is very dark 
and ominous at times. You remember Patrick swayze's character the 
motivational speaker who Donnie calls out as being the fucking antichrist 
lol. Well you hear about him getting busted for running some sort of kitty 
porn dungeon or some shit later in the film.

Christ Jesus the son of Mary did not die for no one to do it by the sins of 
human beings as human beings think all Christians hold him accountable for 
his God alone ... that Jesus son of Mary sent him God like the rest of the 
apostles and Mary, his mother, girlfriend .. and not the Son of God ... 
That God is one and one begets not and did not have oneÔªø
Is that Monica Bellucci? I love that woman!!!Ôªø
To many spoilers!Ôªø
The Passion of the Christ - Made by Non-Jews, thus making it look as it was 
told in the Bible . 

Son of God - Made by Jews, thus making it look like a nice time it was . 
Made for Profit, Simply, a 'feel good' movie . 

Both movies cater to emotion .

Thank God I became a Muslim to realise Esa/Jesus (May Peace be Upon Him) 
was a Prophet . Don't use emotion, use logic . 

There is only 1 God .
No sons, daughters, sisters, brothers, fathers or mothers . 

Just God All Mighty, The Most Gracious The Most Merciful . Ôªø
Shut up, Meg. 
Why does Jewish controlled hollywood keep showing us the old Testament and 
old ass movie the "Ten Commandments" for Christmas but never shows us this 
movie?
The whole trailer gave me goosebumps. The (first christians) Armenian Duduk 
and stories from Jesus Christ make me feel like flying.
Could you please send me that video?
Explain, give me evidence that this happened
sorry mum
You mean Meg? right? plz respond
troppo emozionante e ricco di spettacolarit√†, intrecci, azione e storia!!!
Thats the most jewish sounding name I've ever heard of. I know cause I was 
raised Jewish. Oh, and Mel Gibson sucks. Good filmmaker (even though I've 
never seen any of his films), but he doesn't come from a family that is 
right in the head and accepting of other people's religious choices. His 
father is anti- semite. 
love the music 
i don't want to spoiler, but Jesus will die in the end of the movie :(
$$$$
very niceÔªø
Best movie ever, so bad ass!!Ôªø
I like this preview!
That part with the cops holding the oozies in the air is one of the 
greatest scenes ever imo! Just of the many reasons why Sin City is my all 
time favorite movie.Ôªø
Still one of my favourite trailers. Always makes me want to watch the 
movie.Ôªø

This movie wasnt... that great? good acting and all but man a dull storyÔªø
If you liked Fargo, you'll probably like this one... but if you didn't 
(like me) you will not.
It's not the begining, nor the end of a story, it's the middle of one. 
There's some great acting, but it's (in my view) wasted in a uninteresting 
plot and a uneventful story. There's some interesting dialogues, a lot of 
killing and lots of blood, however there's no action, no drama, no 
thrill... But it did won an Oscar (not that means anything nowadays), so I 
leave it up to you...
See it and judge for yourselves.Ôªø
I hate cheesy, corny, dumb happy endings.  I  love this movie so much. 
 It's gritty and tense.  All the actors were so good even the little 
supporting roles, and Bardem was awesome as Chigurh.  It's not formulaic, 
it's not predictable, it's not a feel good movie.  It reminds me of the 
tone of a lot of foreign non-Hollywood movies.  Ôªø
One of the best acting i have ever seen by Javier Bardem! The next one by 
Christoph Waltz at Inglourious Basterds!Ôªø
Is this movie worth it (Blu-ray) Used for $4.83?? I plan on buying it to 
see it, what do y'all say??Ôªø
Gta?Ôªø
I love this film, the best part is when he is in the gas station with old 
men and he trhows the coin, the best partÔªø
How many Cohen brother movies involve the name Llewelyn? Ôªø
GAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYÔªø
I enjoyed it very much, sad thing Lewelyn Moss died.Ôªø
This film was brilliantÔªø
The best part about this movie is *SPOILER* you think you're watching an 
action thriller and then it ends you realize you were watching a drama with 
a commentary on life and it's stages. The end angered me and then about 20 
min later it clicked and now I can't wait to watch it again Ôªø
Actors in this film performed so well, the got nominated for an awardÔªø
Talk about about being cheated out of a great movie! Fuck you the guy who 
wrote this story u fucking buzzkillÔªø

-Just My Opinion KG3Ôªø
What was up with the ending of this damned movie? I was so pissed at the 
ending, the movie was excellent up until then. Any ending is better than NO 
ending. It's like the movie ended in the middle! I also hated that you know 
who got killed (in case you haven't seen it, not saying who), but they 
never showed his body so I thought it was a faked death right up until the 
credits rolled. WTF??? A bad ending, a sad ending, a happy ending, but SOME 
damned ending, would have been nice. This is what I watched last night, any 
suggestions for tonight and please, nothing this screwed up. i really loved 
this movie until then too, lol.Ôªø
Film Quote of the Day:

"What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?"

- No Country for Old Men (2007)Ôªø
this movie was fucking exciting to watch my heart was racing and shizz
That FUCKING door nob scene! YOU KNOW its coming YOU KNOW! yet you still 
fucking jump out of your seat! 
Yes, well I think the off-screen death just enriches the punch to it, like 
Omni pointed out, you don't expect it, making it more realistic. I don't 
see why it has to be over-dramatized like every single movie ever, then it 
wouldn't be unique, it's a way of saying that the perspective of the plot 
doesn't change the outcome of the plot, and that's exactly why I love this 
movie. "Just looking for what's coming", "well no one ever sees that". 
great film.
it is the point, and it is one of the best movies i've ever seen. Just 
cause it's depressive doesn't mean it's bad, dislike whores. give me a 
break.
$$$$
The cinematography in this movie was great. But as he was out enjoying all 
his freedom and amazing adventures, he left his parents and family worried 
sick about him. I mean he could have called to say he is alive or 
something. He sort of only lived for himself with no consideration for 
anyone else. He learned respect for nature and the Universe, even 
strangers, but no real respect for his own family. Maybe that's a cultural 
thing, I don't know.Ôªø
If you haven't watched this yet, you are missing an amazing movie.
Based on a true story.Ôªø
*Into the Wild*
If you have not already seen this movie, I highly recommend it.
Based on John Krakauer's book, the movie highlights the true story of 
Christopher McCandless's retreat from society to the back woods of Alaska 
where his life becomes a treacherous struggle to survive. #Alaska   
#intothewild   #christophermccandless  Ôªø
Awesome MovieÔªø
Having lived Africa and had the ability to just wonder off into the wild, 
into the grasslands and mountains and forests (I lived in the Drakensburg) 
I understand how it feels to forget all the illusions of society. To just 
be here and know, and to have time to ask the questions that define who we 
are. I understand this very much, and although he died, he was alive when 
he did.Ôªø
For some reason I cried so much at the ending of this movie, and I normally 
don't cry. I think because he reminds me of myself. I would love to travel 
like this. Ôªø
why would anyone go without learning how to make a strong rot resistant bow 
and arrows, farming, hunting, fishing, skinning, natural medicine (fungus), 
etc?  that's why modern education sucks.  lot of useless classes.  even the 
most ambitious modern explorers like ranulph fiennes and bear grylls cannot 
match tribal jungle peoples. Ôªø
Lol why would anyone wanna do that?
When you can just snuggle in bed eating pizza whilst watching vine 
compilations Ôªø
Comments always contain spoilers so don't bother reading past this one. 
Just a heads up.Ôªø
Perfect actor to portray Chris mccandless..just look at his eyes at 2:08. 
Pure joy.Ôªø
very good movieÔªø
I just saw a very selfish kid. Someone who really didn't want to work but 
loved the parks, forest, and wilderness area provided by the taxes of those 
who DO work. Had trouble getting past that. Ôªø
One of the best movies ever. Changed my life!Ôªø
Brilliant movie! Just watched this movie now after wanting to see it for 
years. Ôªø
This movie changed my life the first time I watched it. it hurts to watch 
this movie because I desperately desire the freedom that comes with living 
such a life as McCandless- to get away from all the bulllshit that society 
has to offer. I feel like only then will I be able to truly find myself.Ôªø
It was good, really good.Ôªø
Great movieÔªø
People tend to judge others, instead of thinking about their own life, 
that's the thing. They think someone is trying to force them to live 
Alexander Supertramp life (we are not playing system game, don't worry). 
The thing about this movie, as someone have stated is to do what you really 
want to do, it doesn't have to be this kind of lifestyle, you can do what 
you really want, if you want to dance, play an instrument, sing, or 
whatever you want to do, and not just pursue the life THEY want you to 
live.Ôªø
must watch movie :) loved it ;)Ôªø
This is my most favourite movie I have ever seen. I have watched the film 8 
times. No joke. I love the film, it touches my heart.Ôªø
The movie looks great, although I have yet to see it... the story of Chris 
McCandless is remarkable and inspiring. The Krakauer novel inspired me to 
do my film project on it... (on my channel for those interested)Ôªø
The Sadest Movie ! Ôªø
truly inspiring film, it changed my life. probably the best film i've ever 
seen.Ôªø
This movie is the bedst movie ive ever seen. And the music in the trailer 
is acts of courageÔªø
my goodness this movie, i really don't know how to describe how good this 
movie is....  thumbs up...Ôªø

This one is my fave.I always hated Cho.I have no idea why tho.Harry Potter 
will always be the BEST movie/book series of all time?No
i like that movie :)
I loved this movie, although I think they cut out a lot of stuff from the 
book.
Why is Ron's hair so long??
you're his mom ?! well , ahm, madam your son is an idiot 
Harry Potter was made before Twilight dipshit
thank you sososososo much

This is the official trailer of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Ôªø
@Olivia R I could believe it because CGI effects did not improve much since 
then. Ôªø
It's amazing, you would never believe that the effects came from 2002, you 
would think more like 2012! Absolutely incredible film, phenomenal actors 
and a captivating plot! Awesome movie!
@goldblaze93 Definitely. He actually talked to Lucius back them. Whenever 
Harry sees him nowadays, he would just say "STUPEFY!"
I just watched this yesterday! It's my fav, actually! 1) CHMABER OF SECRETS 
2) Prisoner of Azkaban 3) Goblet of Fire 4) Sorcers Stone' 5) Half Blood 
Prince' I didnt really like the Order of the Phoenix...but this move rock! 
They were so little, theyre so cute! I ‚ô• HP
The last two lines of the trailer are epic!
wow its amazing how much they have grown ohh and u can tell the movie is 
sort of old now we have HD:)
I really enjoy watching harry potter films they entice me into the world of 
magic, i really am going to miss harry potter if u feel the same please do 
hit the suscribe button thank for ur time and peace out
...im suprised the fucking tard americans didnt change this movie title 
called..."harry potter and the box of shhh don't tell anyone.." im sure 
your uneducated redneck braisn can understand what that means....chamber of 
secrets if far too complicated for yanks to understand...
0:11 never heard of that soundtrack before since the prisoner of azkaban 
came out
i luv the dont worry bit at the end
Luv Ron:)
@irongut12345 Really? I understand it JUST fine. Maybe its far too 
complicated for people with tiny brains (like you) to understand. But me 
and I'm sure a lot of other people can understand it just fine. 
sweet! thanks :)
i noticed how most of the HP films came out in either november or july
One of the longer (almost 3 hrs!) and BETTER HP movies
like if you like harry potter 
haha i completely forgot that this movie came out exactly two years before 
my sister was born (:

$$$$
Best Harry Potter movie ever, yup ! üëåÔªø
please... please can someone of you explain to me why you think this is the 
best HP film??Ôªø
Best Potter film after DH Part II and third best novel in my opinion. The 
film just beats Goblet of Fire because the GoF movie missed out Ludo 
Bagman,the World Cup and Crouch's death was obvious.Ôªø
Prisoner of Azkaban is my favourite book and film. It upsets me that they 
missed a lot out of the film. But what they put in was absolutely amazing! Ôªø
Its book is the best among Harry Potter books.Ôªø
This is my least favourite Harry Potter Filmbecause it adds in a lot of 
unneeded material such as extra characters (like Pike) who aren't in any of 
the others and other random add ins that just confused me when I tried to 
watch it.Ôªø
My favorite Harry Potter movie!Ôªø
From 00: at 0:20 just the best with Malfoy who looks Hermione :pÔªø
1:40 oh shit Ôªø
I want to see this :) Ôªø
Nostalgia at it's best right here with the greatest movie of 2004, and the 
best in the series!!! Makes me feel like a kid all over again! Making 
calendars counting down the days until the films release, buying the toys

About to watch this ooooooh yeahhh :) Ôªø
best moviiie everÔªø
1:40 EXXXPEECTION PPPAAATRROROROOOONNNNUUUUUUMMMMMMMMMMÔªø
I remember watching this trailer everyday online as a kid wanting to see 
this film so bad. I got chills at 1:03.Ôªø
I m 22 and i actually love this movie.It is normal?
My favorite Harry Potter book and movie! :-) The movie was really different 
from the book but hey, its Hollywood. ;-P
After this movie no other Harry potter is good (except deathly hallows part 
2)
Best Harry Potter film!!!!!!
I get your point. No problem :) Just wanted to make sure you knew HP is 
british
"Turn to page 394" OH SHIT.
Overall I meant the movie was different from the book due to the inability 
to present certain aspects of the story onscreen in a comprehensive manner, 
and the need for thematic screenplay. Using "Hollywood" in my comment was a 
reference to the movie industry as a whole, regardless where it is based. 
Though perhaps it was unwise of me to use an Americanism on a British film, 
and for that I apologize.
$$$$
What the fuck, the trailer is so shitty it makes the movie look terrible. 
This is one of the greatest movies ever made but trailers are usually 
misleading just all the new movies have awesome trailer but suck. Watch it

Hahaha you sound like an ignorant child that never completed the first

listen. But you're ramble made no sense and was more racist than me calling 
you a Porch Monkey (you don't like it do you, well too bad, "Do onto others 
what you wish them to do on to you"), if you don't understand the concept 
don't bother replying.

Well, Shia's cool and all, but I honestly like Mark Wahlberg moreÔªø
Chool i LOOVE TransformesÔªø
did i just see a dragon
#predaconÔªø
Apparently Mark Wahlberg is meant to be Sam when he is older. Shia said 
that he didn't want to do any more of the Transformers films as he thinks 
they're being dragged out. Ôªø
GOD-DAMN-IT! Will us humans ever learn! We need the Autobots on our side 
permanently and hell the Autobots are willing to! Also, I really want to 
see a cameo from Sam and perhaps see him as a solider? At rank 'Major' 
perhaps? And I really want to see a Lennox, Epps, Simmons and maybe a Carly 
cameo somehow because i think that would be interesting if we see what they 
think about everything happening... Ôªø
Grass explosion at 2:22 ..Ahh bay you devilÔªø
XD looks like grimlocks been bitch slapÔªø
Wheres Sam?!?!Ôªø
The daughter is hott. Shia labeouf was great, gonna miss him. i've enjoyed 
all transformer films so far, so let's see about this oneÔªø
To quote Bryan Alvarez: "MINUS FIVE STARS!".Ôªø
Ya know, I'm sick and tired of the Autobots always getting crapped on by 
these stupid ass humans in these films. They don't know how many times 
they've been putting shit on the line and busted their asses to save their 
dumb planet. And this is the thanks they get? Apparently nobody knows the 
difference between good or evil. Ôªø
God BlessÔªø
I'm just ecstatic that Shia LeBouf is not in it. Ôªø

Whats the Background Track called?Ôªø
So at the end he's still in a dream???
Ôªø
This trailer still sends chills down my spine. Its how you make a trailer, 
doesn't give away any of the plot. And the way the movie was executed. 
Definitely a masterpiece.Ôªø

Bling Bling! I still laugh at that. Funny film.

It's funny how fashion changes within 11 years. Janey's considered as an

such a horrible movie...couldnt stand till the end...Ôªø
This is the only movie that really feels like a dream. Its really trippy.Ôªø
best movie everrrÔªø
by the way.. i love how introvert is JIM CAREY in this movie.. (he being 
extremely extroverted in reality)..
*his character is reminding me of.. myself.. :)*Ôªø
I don't think this trailer was adequate for this movie.  This movie was far 
more a drama and romance than a comedy.  The tones and themes were 
melancholy and at times gave tingles of nostalgia to the audience due 
to......relativity.  Overall, this was a wonderful movie of originality and 
probably vastly overlooked sort of like "City of God".Ôªø
Kinda strange trailer, but guess its pretty difficult to make a trailer out 
of this movie.

Either way, if anyone is thinking about watching it - ignore the trailer 
and please do watch it! 

Both exciting and heartbreaking, beautifully captured and with a lot of 
intelligent messages. A true masterpiece!Ôªø
Watched this movie for the first time last night, began watching at 11:00so when it was over, it was difficult to get into "sleep mode" with so much 
going through my mind. The film is a psychological rollercoaster and it's 
awesome. Ôªø
Absolutely loved it. One of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. By 
far. So good.Ôªø
Is this movie any good. I was thinking about seeing it or the Total Recall 
remake.Ôªø
InceptionÔªø
Who else came from the Daniel Radcliffe's page on facebook? xDÔªø
I love this movie so much!Ôªø
shittiest quality Ôªø
not sure if I get the whole concept of what this is truly about. I'm buying 
DVD's to watch for a movie night with my best friend. Is it worth the buy?Ôªø
my god dunst is soooo hot!!!! and so is kate in that red dew of hers.... Ôªø
Powerful movie, it leaves you thinking! This trailer does no justice for 
it, if your having any doubts about watching this movie, don't.Ôªø
This trailer makes it seem as though this movie isn't the saddest thing you 
will ever seeÔªø
The trailer makes it look like a freaking comedy. Whose idea was it to play 
"Mr. Blue Sky" over the trailer, the happiest song ever made??Ôªø
<3Ôªø
I can't believe it took me so long to watch this movie! It is truly greatÔªø
Love the "beautiful mind" theme they used at the beginning :DÔªø
what's the first song??Ôªø
$$$$
Juliane moore is a good actor but theres no going around it, jodie foster 
wouldve fit the role better. Ôªø
It was ludicrous to have anyone other than Jodie Foster in the role of 
Clarice Starling and since she had no wish to reprise the character, why 
bring her back?  The film's called Hannibal, not Hannibal and Starling, it 
should have just focused on Anthony Hopkins alone with new protagonists who 
were after him. Gary Oldman's character was too pantomine to take 
seriously, the story and script was not in the same league as TSOTL, but it 
had good moments, I like the idea of Lecter living a life of liberty as 
some bohemian curate in Florence, and despite his evil intentions, we the 
audience whether we like to admit it or not, fall for his charm repeatedly 
and want him to remain free.Ôªø
The end part with Ray Liotta's brain lol. Disturbing. Silence of the lambs 
and this were both good.Ôªø
I'm kind of pissed that Jodie Foster isn't Clarice! I know everybody's 
saying that, but it shouldn't even be considered to be in the same movie 
franchise without her.Ôªø
what are y'all complaining about? julianne moore is an excellent 
actress!!!!Ôªø
Jodie Foster deserves the role and she is so beautiful and such a good 
actress than this replacement whore who CUNT even ACT...Ôªø
Despite the many stupid and pointless moments, I actually liked this one in 
general. There's tons of suspense and drama that I like a lot in the 
beginning and middle sections. It's just the ending that goes downhill for 
me.Ôªø
a lot of people dont like this movie and thats understandable but i think 
its pretty interesting and theres a lot of epic momentsÔªø
I find it awesome that some of this film was shot at the Biltmore, the 
largest private estate in the USA, located in my home state NC :)Ôªø
Is this movie as disgusting as I think it is? Ôªø
What the fuck happened to jodie foster's face?Ôªø
Jodie Foster isnt the movie, get the fuck over it. Damn.Ôªø
lets face it the film would have been 10x better if Jodi Foster was in it Ôªø
think this film is very atmospheric and haunting, begins like a Dario 
Argento movie!! Lector though, very scary in silence of the lambs, younger 
and slimmer on the lose isn't as scary as he was behind bars and Clarice is 
less likeable and more of a hard faced cow (part of the appeal of Jodie 
Fosters Starling was she was vulnerable and empathetic)!!! cutting out key 
characters was bad but this film still delivers, great acting from 
Giancarlo Giancelli and ucredited Gary Oldman as horribly disfigured 
paedophile Mason Verger who is oddly amusing and empathetic!! think though 
they should've made him more of a bastard than he is in the movie!! I'd 
give this 4 out of 5, the book's better and the original David Mamet script 
can be found on the net!Ôªø
wow, so passionate comments:)
i think that's great films...incredible history about Hannibal,my the most 
favorite
and everyone on the place i mean actresses:))) but Moore's just the best 
for me anywayÔªø
love this Ôªø
Jodie Foster is a great actress, but so is Julianne Moore. The reason why 
Jodie Foster wasn't in Hannibal was because at the time, they had the 
script of the original ending from the book and Jodie felt it was out of 
character of Clarice to go off with Hannibal (which I agree with) and by 
the time they changed the ending, they had already gone with Julianne Moore 
and then Jodie was already involved in another movie. Both portray Clarice 
at different points in her life, and I would have loved Jodie in both 
movies, but I thought Julianne did a great job for this phase of Clarice's 
life. I am also going by the characterization in the books, not just the 
movies, as I've read all but Hannibal Rising. And you know...if no one has 
seen or heard of Manhunter (Red Dragon story) which was made BEFORE The 
Silence of the Lambs movie, and that had Brian Cox as Hannibal in that. 
Anthony Hopkins was the most iconic though.Ôªø
original,rsÔªø
I really dont like the movies ending or the books because well Hannibal 
could fall in love with Starling but I think its really out of her 
charachter thatshe falls in love with Lecter(so did Jodie Foster)Ôªø

*Hannibal*

 bY *ridley scott*

"is a 2001 USAmerican psychological thriller film  adapted from Thomas 
Harris' novel of the same name. It is a sequel to the 1991 Academy 
Award-winning film *The Silence of the Lambs* that returns Anthony Hopkins 
to his iconic role as serial killer Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore 
co-stars, taking over for Jodie Foster in the role of U.S. Federal Bureau 
of Investigation Agent Clarice Starling.
Set ten years after *The Silence of the Lambs* , the film revolves around 
Starling's attempts to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason 
Verger, captures and kills him. The film's locations alternate between 
Italy and the United States of America. The film's development drew a large 
amount of attention, with *The Silence of the Lambs* director Jonathan 
Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally and actress Jodie Foster all eventually 
declining involvement. Upon release, *Hannibal* broke box office records in 
the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in 
February 2001."

My main problem with this movie is that its not scary as The Silence of the 
Lambs or Red Dragon or at least creepy but its disgusting the best original 
thing about this one is Mason Verger.Ôªø
looks like I got the rough end of the stick didn't iÔªø

@TDNSLEDANG Agreed 
Okay I won't answer it.
@tomexx1984 no your not. sorry but its ave maria. ave means goodbye in 
latin. so its goodbye maria. dont ask why i know that, because i read alot 
of asterix comics. lol
Any good, anything like the games? 
cool 
no i wouldn't as Jason statham could not carry out the coldness of agent 47 
in his performance.
he doesnt even look remotely like 47, hes like 20
"Better" ? you misspelled "awesome" wrong .
Whoever got the idea of combining Ave Maria with Hitman, is a fuckin genius 
Timothy, one of the best actor, i like the way he act in The Girl Next Door 
movie (2004)
Is the women with Hitman was a bitch... 
i love love this movie!!! and the actor is just perfect i woudnt imagine 
someone else to take the role!
Can someone explain me the ending? Who aim the girl at tower and who is 
dead beside him? tnx
Yeah! I Want Jason Statham Played This Role In Hitman 2 Wanted..
thumbs up if you think david bateson should have played 47 in this 
This movie was good, fuck the critics. The only problem is the story. Too 
confusing.
timothy is awesome like him in perfect getaway and justified
the only one who can play Agent 47 is David Bateson,the real Hitman. 
olyphant did a decent job but the producers fucked up.
but he dosent
Fuck off with your stupid comment. I am not being pulled into a comment 7 
months ago...
By spelling right. ;)

was that an orgasm I just experienced???Ôªø
i wanna watch this movie sooooo badly !!!! :(
???but how???? :(:(Ôªø
ja vi o filmeÔªø
Can people PLEASE stop comparing this to the Hunger Games. Yes, it has a 
similar dystopian theme but it is a completely different story. The movie 
is really good but definitely read the book too because it is so much 
better. I was slightly disappointed with the movie compared to the book 
although it is still amazing they just missed out some important parts and 
it's harder to follow. The cast is amazing and Theo James is gorgeous bye.Ôªø
For people who read & watched Divergent (may contain SPOILERS, you've been 
warned)

I have to say that the movie felt like a blur but it was good. But there 
were scenes in the book that I wanted to be shown on the big screen. Those 
scenes are 
-the actual fight between Tris & molly
-the part where Tris questions what's in it for Four (I have to say, this 
part was soooo cute because they are so honest)
-Uriah! Where?
-the part where Tris goes into another instructors fear land scape & 
kidnapping is her new fear then she punces Four because he called her 
pathetic
-the end where Four said those three lovely words

What did you guys want to see from the book but wasn't included in the 
film?Ôªø
She is gorgeous!Ôªø
Omg I saw this. Its a little like The Hunger Games but not really. I think 
it's better in my opinionÔªø
Why are people complaining that it's like the Hunger Games? I'm a HUGE 
Hunger Games fan and I'm psyched that there's another movie that's similar. 
It just gives me more to love and look forward to.Ôªø
Loved it :)Ôªø
Looks like ass.Ôªø
Aaaaaah so good. I have to see it.Ôªø
I'm currently reading the book and OMG I can't wait to see this film!Ôªø
Never read the book don't even know what's it's about but that shirtless 
boy got fine written all over him Ôªø
OK I'll Change the Title:. Hunger GamesÔªø
Hunger Games 3 ?Ôªø
how long will this movie be on till?Ôªø
I've been hating young adult stories for quite some time. Hunger Games was 
like the worst thing ever, but man Divergent has been really good. I 
enjoyed it a lot. The movie was fun and I got the book, the book is pretty 
good too.Ôªø
Just finished watching the movie...! The best one out there :)) Ôªø

At the end did he just go so far back he went to the mothers womb??Ôªø

Perhaps the best movie ever!
Who decided that for a long time, all trailers would have that moronic 
"trailer voice"? It is just horrible, and ruined or near-ruined countless 
trailers.
I love this movie. I want to see it again and I just watched it yesterday. 
I seen this move about six times andenjoy it every time

This is such a good and depressing movie! I just remembered it and I think 
that absolutely everyone should watch this.The trailer isn't very good but 
I promise you it's such a good movie! So basically, it's about this guy who 
is setting out to find the guy who killed his wife, but his mind is unable 
to store new memories, and they all go away after a few minutes. The last 
thing he remembers is the night that the man broke into his house, killing 
his wife and giving him the injury that took away his memory. He writes 
things on sticky notes and tattoos to put together the pieces to find the 
man. All the scenes are backwards, so you see what he does at the end, then 
go backwards and see what happened before. But, there are some unexpected 
things, and the ending just leaves you feeling rather sad.Ôªø

the movie is so stupid its unreal.Ôªø
Did anyone feel a certain type of way when watching the movie? I can't 
describe the feeling, But its like a movie you watch to enjoy not something 
you watch randomly when you're bored? You know?... I feel the same with the 
movie Chloe.. you know what?.. I think its either the soundtrack or that 
Amanda Seyfried brings out the best in movies. Then again I have only 
watched 3 movies with her. Didn't like In Time that much.Ôªø
that movie is sooo badÔªø
Watched it last night, AWESOME story!Ôªø
  I love Megan Fox ‚ô•
You're killing people? No. I'm killing boys ^_^
So crazy, sexy, the most beautiful, cute and hottest woman/girl ever ‚ô•Ôªø
I come here for Megan and Amanda,they both are my fav :)Ôªø
all time low and panic at the disco!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
you can say that it is stupid or something,but I say is is great.
OMG I died. Ôªø
Wait, wait, wait.. She's going to die?! Why spoilers?! Lol.. I loved the 
kiss! I will watch the movie soon.. Reasons: Megan Fox, Amanda Seyfried, 
THE KISS! Hah.. PWEASE read the FanFiction for Brittana from the same 
movie!!! It's amazing! She didn't died and they were actually in love, 
soulmates to speak. /Just the Gleeks-Glee Fans-will get the last thing.. 
lol/ It's really interesting and it's a one-shot. If I haven't saw it I 
wasn't going to watch the movie /yet/ and I actually thought that it's the 
same so I didn't knew it would be with sad end. :'( After the kiss Santana 
said to Brittany "Hmm.. That was.. new.." and yeah.. #fangirlingÔªø
literally dying!Ôªø
collin is hotÔªø
Grrat movie, but they shouldnt have done that to Jennifer (Megan)Ôªø
Then again, Thanks P!ATD for intriguing me into watching this trailer.. :')Ôªø
I liked the move, I thought Megan Fox did a good job. I think allot of 
people have a problem with Megan Fox and it effected how they felt about 
the move. Don't get me wrong its not a great movie by any means, but I 
enjoyed it more than I thought I would.Ôªø
You can barely finish gym class.Ôªø

happen when the time has come we will still calling his righteous name 
Jesus Christ even if you are AntiChrist.Ôªø

+Onmysheet : Salo is garbage. Nothing but shock cinema with no redeeming 
qualities.Ôªø
It has been three or four years since I have seen this film, and it still 
disturbs me. No, it isn't scary in the typical "horror movie" kind of 
way...but it is terrifying in the mental and spiritual sort of way.  No 
ghosts or monsters.  I interpreted it as the struggle of a woman attempting 
to deal with her own sexuality, failures as a mother, natural instincts and 
drive, femininity, the label of women as being the source of all evil, 
etc., as well as her husband's attempts to "treat" her without really 
hearing or understanding her. It is art, and beautifully done.Ôªø
fucked up in a stylish way, i suppose..Ôªø
What if she was dead after the funeral and William just talking his dead

Probably the scariest movie I ever watched. I don't recommend it; it got me 
distracted 3 weeks after seeing it one year ago. It doesn't matter what 
others say, this movie was sheer art, but I don't have the guts to watch it 
again. After a year, I still get shivers down my spine only when I think 
about it.Ôªø

I see, so it's like Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World", but the people 
aren't looking for distractions and sex if discouraged. But what I don't 
get is why they would give away the plot twist that they're copies of real 
people. Who ever made the trailer must not of seen the "Sixth Sense" or 
it's trailer (by the way, incase you haven't seen that movie, watch it. 
Best plot twist ever in film history. I'd have to slap anyone who gives it 
away).Ôªø
THe song in 0:25 is Cristophe Beck - Just Sit Quietly ,)Ôªø
... Ezekiel 44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but 
ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves. 9 ¬∂Thus 
saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart, nor uncircumcised 
in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any stranger that is among the 
children of Israel. 10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when 
Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they 
shall even bear their iniquity.Ôªø
The very end is my favorite.Ôªø
Why Scarlett has to be so hot!Ôªø
If you planned to watch the movie, you don't need to. This trailer sums the 
whole plot in 2:21 minutes.Ôªø
Yeah this trailer is pretty much the movie in 2:21 minutes.Ôªø
I love this movie. Trailer pretty much gives it all away though.Ôªø
None
Loving the Team Rocket logo towards the endÔªø
dat lighting; dat mood; oh my fucking god: 1:07Ôªø
Did Bay pay you to advertise on youtube?
1:31 transformers 3 lool
Everyone in my class, a some thirty people in each clas over six hours, 
loved this movie. It's a miracle because none of us ever agree on anything. 
SEAN BEAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
Best movie this world has ever seen. 
okay, just because Michael Bay made this, doesn't mean it sucks. this movie 
won many awards and is also one of my personal favorite movies of all time. 
stop hating just because of the director. Bay has made good movies, you 
people just focus on the bad ones and call him a bad director. the 
Transformer movies were good. not great i may add, but exceptional. please 
stop hating on The Island.
what the fuck they just showed the entire movie in this preview. definitely 
not watching now.
one of my favorite movie ever
If you want to see this movie, DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER. It will ruin the 
experience. JUST SEE IT!
@lunarvines Quite the opposite, sir.
Yes because explosions are only present in a Michael Bay movie.
Wish I haven't seen the trailer...
LOL. You sound like you have such a happy life. 
And come to think of it, this movie was one of his best even though some 
people didn't like it.

Love the film, hate the trailerÔªø
Song???Ôªø
Those EyesÔªø
No, only KateÔªø
Could have really used a male actor to play the part of Hughes...Ôªø
Leo...love you very much!!!!*3
Great performance of Leo ... love him sooo much :D
Kneed Linda...
what is the last song called in the HTC commercial?
<3 Kate

It is just so funny that the idiots who made this trailer thought it was a 
good idea to give away the biggest surprise of the whole movie.Ôªø
Is this the actual trailer from 2002 (I was about 8-9 years old in 2002 and 
have little memory of those days) ? because I think it would be unlikely 
that they would reveal Gandalf's resurrection in the trailer.  Correct me 
if i'm wrong Ôªø
this still remains to be one of my favorite movies..i have the Trilogy 
which i never lend out..funny story..Ôªø
This movie was so good I had to rewind so many parts so see them over 
again.Ôªø
All-time best movies, and all-time best story. reread and re watch the 
series EVERY year!Ôªø
An awesome trailer for an awesome movie!!!Ôªø
I can't believe I waited a whole fucking year between these. Ugh, the 
agony. And now I can just pop 'em in, one after another. :)Ôªø
i cant wait for return of the king!!!!!! 12 years!!!!! They finally made a 
third!!Ôªø
Haha so many memories! I remember waiting a whole night for this trailer to 
load on my dads dial up and watching it about a thousand times lolÔªø
Requiem for a dream :-)Ôªø
The journey continues...Ôªø
best trilogy of all timeÔªø
1:38 And folks, the national anthem of Youtube; Requiem for a Tower.Ôªø
haha I like that!!!
Requiem for a dream ftw
One does not simply 'over use this music'.
Nearlly 11 years on, and this film still looks incredible. Can't wait to 
watch all 3 Parts of The Hobbit and LOTR back-to-back :D
this makes me feel old but wise 
such a good trailer 
i still dont get why 10000 uruks got defeated by at most, 200 men/elves...
#1 best movies of all time
To be honest,this is the best trailer i have ever seen.Even if i have seen 
TLOTR more than 20 times,i will watch it one more thanks to this trailer.
You got that right, thanks to those dick head amateur youtubers that love 
to over use it in fake sequel trailers just for the purpose of trolling.
SAM WAS IN THE GOONIES...OH MY GOD
The books came out before the movies, so I think that people already knew 
that Gandalf would return :)
$$$$
I found this movie to be incredibly hypocritical and obviously blasphemous. 
They were blatantly mocking God and at the same time the Jews were honing 
in on the 'we are the chosen ones' bullshit. How does that work when you're 
insulting God at the same time. Typical of them. Ôªø
Didn't recognize McLovin is here when I watched it XDÔªø
the most underrated comedy everÔªø
R.I.P. Harold Ramis. His last directed movie. Ôªø
+coldchipsspoils Then you're supposed to be 2014 years old! Oh wow.Ôªø
Watch and learnÔªø
How fitting that Harold Ramis retired from acting after this box office 
bomb to focus on his ailing health. May he rest in comedy heaven. Ôªø
@MarkisthebestEE We speak french where I live.
the ammount of your stupidity amazes me
@Pam4Rob did you just reply to... yourself?
@Pam4Rob Yes it is... in swedish, norweigan. bibel means bible
@Pam4Rob in sweden there is, "Bibel = bible
What are those clothes they are wearing called?
then why are Cain and Abel there? 
yea. that guy is retarded.
heh heh you have 69 likes
women respond to that..Lol
but you werent born in year 1, if they were born in year 0 they should be 1 
year old
this movie doesnt rlly make sense either way because its supposed to be 
year 1. If it was aftr jesus was born wat is cain and able doing? and if 
its the 1st year of all mankind then how is cain and able like 30 yrs old?
so if its the year one why r they like 30 yrs old
JESUS this movie has got Juno Temple, Jack black and Micheal Cera if it had 
Ellen Page and Jesse eisnberg it would have the best actors EVER!
@lmfaoatthat Well you look like you're stupid, so...suit yourself.
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
WTF?? how fucking stupid are you?
hahahahaha

stardust the movie (2007) is actually such a great movie. i just realized 
how much i love it! :DÔªø
Normally I'd agree. But in this case I actually think the film is better 
than the book. Then again, that might just be because I saw the film before 
I read the book. 
0:43 "Eradication Instincts Defined" on the background!!! Great movie, a 
great sleeper.
:D
My favorite movie. I love this movie. 
Nice one!
And now I've seen the whole film.
The book is much better than the movies. But then again, books always are. 
Owen Sleater! <3
THE BEST MOVIE EVER. EEEVER.
i love this movie !! :) 
Ang panget
yep, but i think she was much prettier at young age.
Because this is a movie trailer, not a book trailer. 
Best movie EVER LIKE EVER
Omg... O:29 That soundtrack was from series of unfortunate 
events--"Lachrymose Ferry"
i freakin love this movie.
hei its the girl from romeo and juliet....xD
1:14 I don't remember this bit from the DVD (and I've seen it about ten 
times)...hmm. 
Adorei este filme, continua a ser o meu filme favorito.
Everyone is talking about how much they love this movie. But no one 
mentions the book. This is based on a BOOK. Read the BOOK.
I enjoyed it very much! It has elements that I liked even though fantasy is 
not my favorite genre. They edited the part were the 3 witches killed that 
other star and all look young and beautiful again, when Tristan is being 
told by one of the stars.
This movie is such a sleeper work of art. If you are looking for a GREAT 
FILM that can be enjoyed by everyone from a 6 year old to a 100 year old, 
this is it...
Based on this, it has lots of additional plot next to the book's, but 
sometimes less is more, not gonna watch, I don't want to ruin the book :P
danke f√ºr die HD Version!
$$$$
amazing movie...Ôªø
What are those circles on the ground...shown at 1:21 ???Ôªø
so fucking.. nope i cant i quit!Ôªø
Such a great film, still enjoy it every time I watch itÔªø
It's a great film. Really realistic, and is something many people relate 
to Ôªø
most underrated film. this is one of my favorite movies. ive watched it 
over & over & i didnt know why until i recently realized i never really 
understood the movie until now. the main message this film conveys is so 
stong. SOLITUDE. Ôªø
this is just a perfect film I've seen it so many times hehe i know every 
line and every song, my gf doesn't understand why i love it so much, its 
I'm possible to describe but its just amazingÔªø
Clooney should've won best actor for his performance Ôªø
I just watched this.
It's a really beautiful little film with some outstanding *extras**.
The direction is great, and it has a great soundtrack :-)
Can't say anything bad about it at all.

Thanks to +blinkbox's Movie Mondays weekly promotion, I rented it for only 
99p (¬£0.99). I'm very happy about that :-)

*extras** : Clooney plays a guy hired by companies to fire their employees 
for them.
The employees are played by people who are either fantastic actors or were 
mined from *real* folk somehow.
They play their little tragedies very well indeed.Ôªø
@Axxrat well if what you're looking for in a movie is pointless nudity I 
understand that you were disappointed
your relationships are what makes your life worth living.
It's a great movie. It has elements of comedy and drama. Also, it goes 
through a period of time, that is probably relevant now or before, that is 
easy to relate too. Surprisingly, a well made movie 
Clooney doesn't do porno's my friend. I expected this to be better than it 
was, that's all. A 7.5/10 rating on the imdb suggested a good film. It was 
not so good. Both my wife and I found it slow and boring. As for the 
bedroom scene, I stand by what I said, highlight of the movie, which of 
course doesn't say much does it?
i dont like this kind of trailers were they brag about every magazine that 
wrote about their movie, anyways im going to watch it haha
i wish i've seen this before, the past 4 months i've been in an 
excruciating existential crisis. I questioned everything I thought to be 
true. And discovered now what this movie says to be true the slower we move 
the faster we die. moving is living. I hope people pay attention to this, I 
want to save them from the pain I went through. I'm grateful to have 
survived it mainly because I'm too afraid to kill myself. But when it's 
hurting really bad I thought I just might. But keep moving it matters
Nope, I prefer a good movie lol. Never seen a twilight movie in my life, 
gimmie a break.
Were you expecting this to be a movie, or a porno?
See above
oh Vera... be my mom, please.....
This movie is about people that isolates themselved from their social life 
why i dont know everybody has different reasons but in the end he went back 
to the place he belonged "up in the air"
So i just finished this movie and it's a lot better than the trailer, i 
really enjoyed it
i dont even think of him that way he's old.. lol that just cracked me up
Personally I found this movie to be very charming and relaxing. Don't let 
one poor review spoil a good film! :D 
Anna Kendrick , you're amazing , you absolutely are my favorited actress
 came here from chelsea fc website, torres recommended it!
$$$$
The best movie ever!!! I loved all the characters.. GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW 
IF YOU DIDN'T YET!! GO!!Ôªø

*Sony Pictures Acquiring Rights to a Movie About Steve Jobs?*
There is only one movie about the life of Steve Jobs I would love to see, 
and it is made by *Pixar*, the animation company Steve Jobs bought from 
George Lucas back in the day. I really hope Pixar will do that in the near 
future. There are powerful lessons to be learned from the life of Steve 
Jobs -- a Pixar movie would appeal to and inspire both kids & adults alike. 

*What do you think?*

I attached a trailer of Pixar's last true masterpiece, UP!Ôªø
Only Disney/Pixar films can reduce people (including grown men) to tears! 
they practically had me bawling by the end of the movie! There has to be 
something wrong with your tearducts if you dont feel a little teary eyed by 
the end of the film!
with my wilderness explorer GPS we'll never get lost........ ooooooopssss 
ROFL...
77 dislikers doesn't like the dog!!!

I cry on pixar films :L
smosh version: "so long boys!!! pfffffffffffft!" *throws balloons into the 
sky but nothing happens
i just finish watching it.. i tried not to cry.. :(
This film gets really sad when the sof piano music is played and Ellie 
dies. I'm not gonna lie, I shed a few tears in the cinema >.<
The preview of this doesn't show how good this movie is. At first I didn't 
think it looked good, but when I watched it, it was a masterpiece.
i cried so many times. this is an amazing movie. the beginning killed me.
Pixar is the best.
I was hiding under your porch because I love you :D
this movie is a trip, for real
79 people cryed in the cinema Poor guys :(
1st time iv'e cried in a long time..

This movie came out in 2008... and it still gives me chills. lol really 
good movie. Ôªø
@lucread Mediocre :P ????? You kidding?
@lucread Yeah man, what about Qui-gon Jinn? Philistines.
@mibaja He uses mainly Krav maga, Its a self defence style... Not like girl 
self defence, but self defence has no rules... Its a style Commando's and 
israel army uses. Its concentrated to kill/incapitate the target as quickly 
and painfull possible. 
this movie is such a perfect example of what modern liberal parenting does 
(don't "shelter" your kid, let them "experience" the world, blah blah blah)
Awesome movie. I highly recommend it to everyone I know.
@joker666954 He voices the father of the Lone Wanderer(person you play as).
@sweetdreamsx33 does it have a happy ending ????? i dont wanna watch it if 
it doesn't :P
i agree his voice is awesome
this is somewhat creepy considering im going to France this summer......
I wonder at the wisdom behind kidnapping traveling white Westerners to sell 
into slavery. Seems like they would want to kidnap someone less likely to 
be noticed when they go missing.
pure badass motherfuckery
@mibaja He does mainly Krav maga, Its a self defence style... Not like girl 
self defence, but self defence has no rules... Its a style Commando's and

damN! where can I buy those JOHN LENNON glasses? damN! nice movie btw! ^^
Jude Law ‚ô•
HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!
Just come back from seeing it and i thought it was brilliant! but i can not 
recall 1:18 to 1:24 being in it...
When I first saw this trailer, I was watching Harry Potter and the 
Half-Blood Prince. I remembered the scene where RDJ was naked and cuffed to 
the bed when the Potter crew was in the Weasly house. Mr. Weasly had a 
pillow in front of him and I leaned over and told my friend "The key lies 
behind the pillow." She wouldn't stop cracking up.
God this man makes me drool..... Geeze, there isn't anything as hot as RDJ. 
And this is a GREAT movie!!! :)
wow most hav supernatural I.Q.
@lovleelaura88 In the original story "A Scandal in Bohemia" Adler is NOT a 
love interest for Holmes at all. She was a former lover of a Bohemian King 
who was now married to a man named Norton. It clearly states in the story 
that Holmes had no feelings of love or romance for her. Because she was not 
only beautiful, but so smart and cunning that she outwitted Holmes in his 
quest to recover a compromising photograph of her and the king, he viewed 
her to be the only woman worthy of his admiration.
The Best.

This is the best movie I've ever seen. So influential and beautiful. Every 
word so meaningful. Ôªø
WTF was the closed captioning talking about?Ôªø
This movie gives me so much life. Ôªø
Seriously one of the most depressing movies ever created.Ôªø
Should have called it "Dances With Samurai."  Another romanticized 
simplification of history and culture.Ôªø
This was the best movie I've ever watched.   Ôªø
I Love You Ôªø
Happy 10 year anniversary when released in theatres.Ôªø
Old Japan was good...But Japan lost good culture..Ôªø

love this movie. I want to improve like that.
Great people. I moved there, from England. I never looked back.

almost 10 years further ahead and i'm still watching it.

Underrated movie with an absolutely astounding soundtrack!! though the 
style of this trailer reminds me of the one at the beginning of Tropic 
Thunder
that guy looks like edward kenway for AC4
1:06! that's the guy from Inception! O.O
yes
It don't seem likely because people think it's some magic or what....First

SAW theme at the end. Lol!Ôªø
i saw a box lololÔªø
If i could press the button to kill a million people or be made to watch 
this film again. I'd press the button. Stupid film, the moment the 
supernatural alien rubbish came up it turned into a dumb film.Ôªø
The weirdest movie everÔªø
I'd take the millionÔªø
Whyyy did they use SAW music at the end? haha omg.Ôªø
this is like an Eve effect its always our fault damnÔªø
if some i dont know will die then i would pushed that botton in a heart 
beatÔªø
Threat other people as you want other people to threat you. It¬¥s that 
simple when you see the end of this film.

I would not say I will never kill people, but if I will kill people I will 
have a personal conviction about killing those specific persons! Not just 
push a buttom to kill some stranger I will not even get to watch die. For 
the oppurtunity to kill someone I would demand to get to know exactly who 
this is and say no to the money or burn the money. This movie sucks because 
these people do not even have the will/spine to take responsibility for 
their own actions. What¬¥s even more boring is they don¬¥t suspect anything 
supernatural going on here! Because they are materialists with no ability 
to think outside of THEIR box. To topp it off they don¬¥t take this 
seriously. It¬¥s like a play "Should we do it just to see IF anything will 
happen? He can¬¥t possibly tell if we did it or not".

They are also stupid enough to only care about the money. It would have 
been better if they actually belived that they would also have to pay a 
price for what they where doing and so where aware of what they where doing 
AND COULD STAND FOR IT. I would also prefer that they actually WANTED to 
kill someone, like in hot blod murder, not cold blood murder. In this movie 
it¬¥s not even about a choise at all, so it¬¥s not even cold blood murder. 
It¬¥s just a PLAY for them and then they get punished for being stupid 
enough not to understand there will be serious consequences to serious 
things such as killing people. It¬¥s not even their own personal vendetta 
and he didn¬¥t promise them any safety if they did this, so they are really 
stupid for beliving they would get away with this without consequenses. 
Such suckers in the end!Ôªø
Wasn't this a twilight zone episode or something?Ôªø
looks really good!!!! so much better than so many movies nowadays. and omg 
his WIFE is the one who's gona die?? that's why u dont fucking push that 
button! i wouldnt, knowing someone dies. (plus thats what the whole 
experiment is about isnt it, having couples being picked and killing their 
partner. hahh very clever.) well this trailer kind of spoiled everything 
for me but still want to see Ôªø
Saw theme songÔªø
Fuckin wierd movie, didn't understand any of it. Ending was interesting 
thoughÔªø
Worst movie ever.Ôªø
Well u ppl who wud press the button need to remember that someone could 
press their button and kill u.Ôªø
Someone dies every few seconds anywayÔªø
this film was awesome. just think..........adam and eveÔªø
But hundreds of people die every second around the world?Ôªø
Ifunny...Ôªø
cheap movie, don't waste your time.... Ôªø
Killing people they don¬¥t have a clue who they are for loads of money -Many 
people make a living on these type of jobs. Cold blood murderers empty of 
emotions inside. What a meaningless and depressing life if you only care 
about money. I¬¥d take emotions over money any time.Ôªø
WTF ? SAW soundtrack ?Ôªø
who is the man between the kid in the window? in the end of the story. 
You know, giving your opinion on something like that is always just fine, 
but acting like you have found the perfect solution and everyone else 
should agree with you is not. Many people would think of it the other way 
around and say that the child has much more years to live while the mother 
has already lived half her life. I'm not saying you're entirly wrong, i'm 
just saying you should not think of your opinion as the only one acceptable.
This is based off of Richard Matheson's short story "Button, button". 
Though it's 50,000 per death.

This movie is funny.. love the Kevin Smith moviesÔªø
shut the fuck up and watch the movie in peace with out crying, I thought 
this was a trailor Ôªø
Why in the actual fuck did these people decide that reviewing trailers was 
necessary whatsoever 
i have thismovie onmy computer
Stop the video at 2:20. The rest is rubbish people talking rubbish.
she's not a whore she's a nice lady 
They talk about star wars in all Kevin smiths movie you retards . They are 
all linked from clerks to mall rats to chasing Amy to dogma ect. You two 
ass clowns obviously know nothing about Kevin smiths movies . The things 
you are being critical of are the whole point of the movie and you know 
what if you think im gonna base my opinions of a movie on a piece of wanna 
be yuppy euro trash and. Stuck up snobby bitch say then you need a reality 
check.
im sorry but these two presenters are just fucking stupid. cmon lets get 
the real the film is fucking hilarious and seth rogen is shooting is way to 
the top of the comedy spectral 
HaHaHaHa! you made me laugh! opinions are personal.. And if the movie 
sucks! for me it will always suck! So! Respect Opinion of people.. it is 
seen where you come from! Dont reply this! Dont be a kid! Mature Or Grow 
Up... Dont know! As I said I'm not an english speaker
GET THE FUCK OFF YOUTUBE, AND SHUT THE FUCK UP, THE STUPID BITCH WAS JUST 
AGREEING WITH EVERYTHING THE COCAIN SNIFFING NOSE DUDE WAS SAYING...
I always, ALWAYS wanted to watch STARWHORES
This is worse then TheReplyGirl, they use the titel "official movie trailer 
HD" to get views from people that want to watch the trailer, just the 
trailer. Nowhere in the title it says "trailer review". Yet that's what it 
is. And the worst part of it is that they actually make money off of this.
These presenters are a disappointment to the Human race. "Why pick Star 
Wars a movie so old"... Are you fucking serious?
THANK YOU
That's what Jews do best. 
Two moron nobodies dissing a great movie. Ignore and dislike. 
So glad I didnt see this pile of shit
what were they smoking when they were putting the apple logo on the 
mabbook, upsight down!! seriously?
Fuck you!!! balls licker Kevin Smith is coool and you like to suck the 
balls to horses go eat your own shit!!! 
lol
so true they sound like they're trying to be sophisticated but they're 
actually fucking derricks
why did they choose star wars??!! if the answer isn't obvious than you 
should stop reviewing movies....
miss to you two, don't judge the book by it's cover
Fag and stupid bitch.

Best Sci-Fi film and probably film on 2009, IMHO.

It was really interesting that they managed to create an unknown and 
mysterious character as a protagonist. I was really captivated by that 
fact. You can see what I mean if you watch the movie. I found it online on

@meck425 tell your friend that gnocchi is plural and bolognese is singular. 
so you have a grammar error there..and yes i do know it's a name i watched 
the trailer. 
@tennnisfunk Sure is.
...That's a trick question
Hi everyone! One of my friends, a top graduate of USC film school wrote and 
directed this short film called THE BROKEN HEART OF GNOCCHI BOLOGNESE. It's 
a whimsical, fun, romantic comedy with a similar sensibility to ROYAL 
TENENBAUMS.Ôªø The trailer is listed under my favorites on my YouTube page or 
you can find it by searching for the title. The entire film is available on 
the iPad app Play Festival Films. The link for the iPad app is listed in 
the description of the trailer. Check it out. Thanks!
"What characters? There's a bunch of little kids dressed up in animal 
costumes." Royal, what a guy...
@houlihanw I disagree I was born in the in 91 and the life aquatic is one

That makes me know "Paul Dano" can act.Ôªø
god damn, this movie is going to be SO GREAT
This movie was the best, I've seen in quite some time. I wish Daniel the 
best tonight at the Oscars
Amen.
Sorry gonna need more than that to get me interested, looks very boring and 
with a title like that I actually want to see some blood in the trailer, 
yall so easily ammused
Great movie but i do think it is overated, it isnt the best movie of 2011. 
And No Country For Old men is even more overated. That movie was a big 
disapointment
Ok, well I didn't mean any offense by it. I'm just glad you liked the movie 
(I am assuming you did by the comment).
LOL how come Paul Dano always seems to get hit at some point in most of his 
movies? Ha idk just pointing it out.. i love that boy, amazing actor! I 
really wanna see this movie
yes..good movie...I'm betting you were surprised to see me at the Berlinale 
premiere
1.58 the laugh of Satan...
The movie's a little slow, but it's pretty good nonetheless. It's more for 
the observant and thinking person than the one looking for a good action 
flick. In short, it's based on the book Oil! by Upton Sinclair, and is a 
study of Religion and Greed. Brother Eliah is based on Reverend Aimee 
Semple McPherson, who found my denomination, the International Church of 
the Foursquare Gospel. Interesting story, you should wiki it if you get the 
chance.
When I saw this movie for the first time, I saw Daniel Plainview as an 
utterly evil character, but the second time I saw it, I saw him as 
extremely sympathetic. He truly worked hard to achieve his success, and you 
could tell in the earlier parts of the movie that he really loved his son a 
lot. When his son goes deaf, the obsessively competitive part of him begins 
to hate his son for the inconvenience that he causes, but you can see the 
emotion in his face when he leaves his son on the train.
15 year old kid is touchy touchy
That laugh at the end. It's brilliant.
In a way it is.
Well, so's your face. ;)
PTA doesn't want to have a classic fairy tale ending, he wants to have more 
of a realistic ending to portrey what the characters life was really like. 
The movie is basically about life and people getting in each others way to 
get what they want....its everywhere just look around. It's about how hard 
it must have been to do what he did at that time from scratch, persistence, 
and people misusing Christianity to get what they want...Eli. Its very 
interesting and intruiging if you keep watching.
Amazing film. One of the best performances in ever since gangs of new York.
I saw this movie last night... breathtaking. The movie was an amazement, it 
was unbelievable. One of my favorite movies of all time, and easily one of 
the greatest films made since the turn of the century.
@dillonator its not a bad movie but i didn't deserve its awards its a good 
movie but a not the master piece a lot of people think it is 
I believe that as well. I definetly think anyone 17+ should see this movie. 
(17+ because some people might get lost in what all is happening) If anyone 
is watching this trailer and is thinking of renting it, PLEASE DO. You will 
not be disappointed in any way.
Also, Daniel and Eli are really after the same thing, but Eli is using a 
religious front that he himself may not even be full aware of if 
confronted. Daniel, while greedy is straighforward about his greed and 
therefore sees himself as much more noble than Eli even though they have 
the same financial desires.
great movie (again the trailer simply does not do it justice but what to do)
whoa 1:40 better not be a gay scene...>>

I noticed they edited out the part where the "007" logo turns into "NOV

skyfall was too slow and boring , cadino royale is bestÔªø
2 thumbs up!!!Ôªø
Can someone tell me, what is the name of the song which begins at 0:59?
Thanks!Ôªø
Idiots... I live in Montenegro.. it is not filmed in Montenegro.. It is 
filmed in Czesh Republic...Ôªø
Skyfall is better, because it's like a blend of the new and old bond..
Of course I haven't, it premieres on 26th in my country.
lol this came out 6 years ago
Can't wait to see it and have my own impression. So it's negatively 
different?
After the end of the world.
than you havent seen skyfall yet
casino Royal is in terms of action not as good as Skyfall however the fact 
that that Bond has a REAL relationship that is so different, that he 
actually falls for someone. That is what makes this film amazing, and on a 
par with Skyfall, if not better than it.
It maybe have q real James bond in 2013. I will discovered him within march 
of 2013.
A poker scene in Casino Royale is more thrilling than the whole Skyfall.
OMG RLY?! I didn't know that.. *SARCASM SPHERE SELF TEST COMPLETE*
Skyfall has unseated Casino Royale as the best Bond film ever, but Royale 
is still brilliant. 
When does it come out!?
Good lord this came out 6 years ago!!!
I think half of the dialogue in this trailer wasn't even included in the 
movie.
Skyfall is The Dark Knight of the new Bond movies.
I concur.
Hahahahaha youre funny,, you should be a comedian
I'm assuming you haven't seen Skyfall yet?
skyfall is the dark knight executed wrong. Long boring movie. 
It's just personal opinion, they are really at the same level. Objectively.

This is them if Jack didnt die!Ôªø
the worst movie i seen ever and bad author i dont know why thes author 
wrote thes bad end and why leo (frank) love his wife even the author why 
dont wrote that the wife (kate) have fuck another man thes is not fair that 
frank stell love her !! she betrayed him ! and dont tell him .. thes is the 
worst movie ever i seeen and made me cry that the man must be love girl who 
betrayed him with another man and hate him :(((Ôªø
Has anybody sean "Revolutionary road." It's a t.v series in the States or 
in England I think. This the trailer. You can't watch this anymore but you 
can watch on youtube.Ôªø
@bellydancingdream - True, everything always depends. Everything is defined 
by sensitive dependence on changing conditions. So if you want to make a 
point, I'd be interested to hear the specifics.
Watched this three times on HBO. Never caught the beginning of the film but 
it is so great anyway. Whenever Leonardo and Kate star on a film, it is 
always EPIC.
@cheekimafia No This Is A Complete Different Move Then Titanic Because They 
Got To Work Together Again
both the best actors of their time ! 
After watching this trailer who would ever want to watch this? So 
depressing!
Movie is full of true emotions, course played by good actors. Like others 
said a roller coaster of life. We shared few months with them.Sorry to say, 
but Jesus or God would have not helped them. Women was much more stronger 
than this Men. It was akward to feel her hopes flushed away, he was happy 
even though that he said otherwise. She was willing to give everything. In 
the end she made a decision which took my ground away. Strongest scene, the 
old man turning his earing off......... 
Hacen linda pareja
Did this movie make anyone else cry?
This film is so powerful and upsetting because it reflects reality. Many 
people seem to essentially get into conventional traps, be it massive debt 
or having children too early, they work jobs they hate and forget about 
what it means to be alive.
The actress also said that her husband called her before these scenes, 
saying ( Come, O Kate all mature here ) . How much is funny hhhhhh ÿåÿåÿå
we had to read this book for AP english it was sooo boring and depressing! 
The fact of the film maker be her husband, it helps, don't turn worse and 
despropotional the film. It was great love it ;)
are they psycho killers or something?
This movie is tragically amazing.
love this movie
So this is what would've happened if the titanic made it to new York.. 
Well, she said a rich life wasn't as important as their love!! Lol!
I'm 17 and when I watched Titanic the first time I was three with my 
parents and of course I didn't know what was going on until I was 8. I just 
recently watched it last week making the count of ten times. Leo and Kate 
should be in more movies together. Heck they should been together in real 
life. They look good together in looks and personality. Now I'm done 
ranting *sighs heavily*. :)
Watched the movie, it was depressingly great. Kate and Leo are BOTH amazing 
in it. You can feel their raw emotions in every scene, not to mention great 
chemistry together. Both deserved oscar-winning performances.
@peacelvr815 did you just ruin the movie for me?

One of the best movies ever !!!Ôªø
mogadishu is not afghanistan ok, the milltia will face u straight on, men 
with balls u will never come across! when the guy said in the film skinies 
cant shoot is like saying black man cant jump, every single man in somali 
is holding a machine gun or pistol, guns been used all sort of way in 
mogadishu, these guys fight every day like in black hawk since 1991/2008 
factsÔªø
great movie wtf this trailer is shitÔªø
MORROCO / HOLYWOOD Ôªø
My teacher recommended this movie..But is it worth watching? Just want an 
honest opinion. c: Ôªø
awesome trailer, awesome movie.Ôªø
Black Hawk Down is a 2001 British-American war film directed by Ridley 
Scott. It is an adaptation of the 1999 book of the same name by Mark Bowden 
based on his series of articles in The Philadelphia Inquirer, which 
chronicled the events of the Battle of Mogadishu, a raid integral to the 
United States' effort to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The 
film features a large ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, Eric Bana, 
Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner and Sam Shepard. The film won 
two Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound at the 74th Academy Awards. 
The film was received positively by American film critics, but was strongly 
criticized by Somalis. I like this movie because it's action packed and 
based on a true story.Ôªø
IMO, the best military action movie EVER... the war sensation is sooo realÔªø
Just watched this movie, very great and very emotional. A movie I'll never 
forgetÔªø
Best film ever.
I gagged at one part when they did an open operation on a guy's knee lolÔªø
<3 The war dogs out there, Semper Fido.Ôªø
Woow i'm somalian and i have lived in norway all my life i haven't been 
there but i'm crying for the sake for my country . I don't blame anyone for 
this its just somalian people (clans) going at each other . But i'm sick of 
reading the comments here wooow like seriously you guys are like R.I.P 
heroes wooow they are not heroes they just made my country worse so please 
shut up about this you don't know anything even if you read what wikipedia 
says lolÔªø
Favourite movie ever. Hate the scene where the 2 snipers came too help .. 
God. Cried like a baby. What happened to them ...Ôªø
21 years later, and not allot has changed...Ôªø
rambo19962007 US 10th Mount division was hardly in the battle dumb shit 
anything else you want to make up?

yes parts of the movie aren't true, like the way Pilla died. he wasn't on 
the 50.cal he was in the back firing his m60Ôªø
I'll never forget those words "We got a Blackhawk down, Blackhawk down.".Ôªø
Freedom Ôªø
which is better ... this, act of valor or lone survivor ...? 
I  think personally act of valorÔªø
For anyone saying the U.S rangers and  Air Force Pararescuemen who fought 
in the battle of Mogadishu are not heroes, or at least were on the same 
level as the Somalian militia clearly are two ignorant to know the facts. 
These soldiers went to war against  Mohamed Farrah Aidid (and of course the 
supporters) who had starved roughly 100,000 civilians. They didn't intend 
to fight the whole town they merely wanted to capture Mohamed Farrah Aidid. 
in order for them to do this roughly 3000 Somalian militia were killed. 
they were killed to stop more deaths. To call those 18 U.S soldiers who 
died and those who fought anything but heroes is just wrong ( also 1 
Malaysian and 1 Pakistani soldier).       Ôªø
Best war movie Black Hawk Down. Best war book Jasmine's War.Ôªø
Track for the second half of the trailer is the last minute or so of Moby - 
Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?Ôªø
0:22 That's exactly what the U.S. and the U.N is/has been doing: watch 
Syria destroy itself on CNN.Ôªø
AWESOME MOVIE !Ôªø
This film is straight-up shit, haha. And isn't there racial inaccuracies in 
this film. I mean I know there are bantu people in mogadishu, but there's 
no somali people in this film. Ôªø
Just a question... Does somebody know the title of the music which starts 
at 1:28 please? Ôªø

I can't believe I just realized the main actress used to play Eloise!!! 
She's such a talent, and always has been :)Ôªø
Im crying. And im depressed. But i still love this movie.Ôªø
The only movie I cried for lolÔªø
Sofia Vassilieva was amazing in this film.Ôªø
this ending was sad, but the book ending made me cry.Ôªø
Raise your hand if you cried

Im reading this book and its amazing and I love it ands its so good and I 
think other people should read it if u watch the trailer for it (which I 
have right here ) and find it confusing I can explain it or u can google it 
but its really goodÔªø
literaylly the best book i've ever read Ôªø
I cried really hard after this movieÔªø
this is so sad i might cry):):):Ôªø
The book appealed to me more than the movie ever did, but nonetheless, it's 
an OK movie. I'm just not satisfied with the fact that some rather 
important characters were left out or their story was downgraded. And the 
fact that the ending differed is kind of dissatisfying in a sense. Of 
course, this is just my opinion. Overall, Jodi Picoult is an amazing 
author, and the book is worth the read.Ôªø
this made me cry and makes you think how delicate life is ! x x x   Ôªø
Great Movie! but oh so different from the book! especially the end :(Ôªø
okay the book was amazing but they changed the entire ending to the movie, 
I was so disappointedÔªø
and beautifulÔªø
I never cried so much in a movie before I saw thisÔªø
what the fuck???? born to save my sisters life,, o havent seen the movie 
yet but that sounds fucked up,, i mean depressing,,, Ôªø
Hated the ending. I wanted it to be that the younger sister was actually 
suing her parents for her sake and rights to her body when it was her suing 
her parents for the sake of her dying sister so her sister could die with 
no more treatments and no more hospitals. If that were me I'd be suing my 
parents for using me just to be a donor for my cancer sister. I mean she 
was born just to keep her sister alive. That's f*****Ôªø
The trailer did no justice for the movie.Ôªø
cerealnoobtmz stay strong, I hope you get well. :')Ôªø
This movie was phenomenal, I don't even mind that the ending was different, 
since I understand why they did it. I do wish that the brother was a bigger 
character in the movie (equivalent to the book), I thought it really added 
another element, Ôªø

If you have extra time this weekend, this is a great entertaining movie. I 
like Old English but this has a bit of everything including of how people 
try to demote you when you are way better than them. This reminded of a 
note one of my former editors once said: ‚Äúyou work so hard making the rest 
of look like we are on vacation.‚Äù Sarcasm and humor is also included in 
this movie which I hope you enjoy but please note, I have no affiliation 
with this movie and if you don't like it, don't shoot the messenger ;-) Ôªø
I don't like this trailer because it makes you rely and depend on the voice 
over guy, when in the Shaun Of The Dead trailer it relied purely on the 
clips to get tyou to watch it and it was genius because it worked!Ôªø
the film is great but this trailer is rubbish is it an American trailer
 Ôªø
badass!Ôªø
Hag.Ôªø
whats the name of the song that starts at 0:52 ?Ôªø
seriously one of the most underrated films of all time.Ôªø
Shaun of the Dead is a great film and this is too
Recommend this to all of you who have not seen it yetÔªø
The worlds end trailer brought me hereÔªø
Haha I remember this movie! Awesome as hell! The detectives are cool xDÔªø
Whenever people ask to name misleading trailers, this is the one that 
always comes to mind most.  Most of it focuses on Danny's wackiness and 
makes it look like it focuses mainly on the cops' antics, and it almost 
completely hides the disturbing conspiracy angle that drives the story.Ôªø
Narp?Ôªø
I have honestly watched this movie over 20 times. Every single time, I 
laugh at the same line. "Your a doctor, deal with it. " "Yeah Mother 
Fucker."Ôªø
Ha ha ! My favorite part is when he stuck the fork into his eye but really 
stabbed a ketchup packet....I think. You know what I meanÔªø
don't watch this trailer because it has many spoilersÔªø
The more I watch this movie the better it gets
Hodor!
nothing 
this movey rocks
Brilliant film, i recommend it to anyone
lol
By the power of gray skull
I love this movie:) 
Shaun of the dead is still amazing though :)
Me too. They are some of the only actors if not only ones I support and buy

the first song is clubfoot by kasabian
Amen!
KASABIAN <3 ! 
Now if only there was a licensed video game like the upcoming Star Trek 
game, but with something more than standard cover-based shooting...
And thank you Universal!
Club Foot! :D 
Define Interesting :D.....Oh God Oh God we all going to die :D
I love the song they are playing, what is it called?
i bet the first time any fan of the series saw this back in 2005, they 
pissed themselves. and the trailer, in all its glory, doesn't even scrape 
the surface.
fuck you fox
$$$$
This was on TV last night--anyone else catch it?Ôªø
I am a HUGE fan of this series, and concept.
Love the first movie, and I adore the comic series.
The only bad thing is, it`s almost coming to a stop.
This should go one for quite some time more, anyone with me on that 
opinion.Ôªø
THIS MOVIE SCARRED ME. I WATCH THIS WHEN I WAS 10 AND IM 16 NOWÔªø
Saw this movie for the first time last night--anyone else a fan of it? I 
was definitely entertained.Ôªø
I used to love vampires because I thought they were vicious monsters, but 
then came twilight and ruined that for me, so now, I hate anything with 
vampires. But when I watched this movie, I fell in love again. I LOVED how 
scary vampires are in the movie.Ôªø
How freaking creative is this?? I love this whole premise, and hadn't ever 
thought about Alaskan Night being associated with vampires. The guy who 
thought that up was pretty darn creative
i thought it might be stupid but then i heard Apocolypse please by Muse 
start playing and the i was like HELL YEAH!!!!!!
Twilight vampires are not even close.
I swore i saw one of these guys trying to bum a smoke off me once. 
Twilight needs free advertising, and negative publicity is also a form of 
advertising, so keep doing it guys! eventually you'll see Twilight make as 
much money and be as popular as Justin Bieber is, and for the same reasons.
Can't they just move? Is there some kind of wall all around the place or? 
Just get the fuck out of there. haven't seen the movie get btw. i'm just 
about to, i might regret this comment.
Bring back the old school vampires fuck the Lovly dovy twilight
this is the only true original vampire movie to be released next to 
Daybreakers which was fantastic as well. Twilight is bull-crap. vampires 
are supposed to be horrifying, not normal looking and glowing like diamonds 
when seen in sunlight. how stupid is that!
@bizarreunderworld Robert Pattinson isn't gay. Case Closed.
now this is where my respect of vampires come from.
MUSE!
Agree
@punkprincesskj You probably saw the second one named "30 days of night: 
dark days" =P
Man I'm never going to watch this I already fell off my chair at 0:10 .
@MulticolorBriNicole Case closed? Lol wtf? Theres no investigation here 
female, he's borderline fag. 
fuck twilight.
@12 , Already scared the shot out of me :'(
@andyrooney12 bahahahaha. your funny.
@kruuuuune philp defranco .... sexphil ...no, i'll send you a link.lol
Pro tip: Don't live in Alaska. (yes I know it's beautiful, but I'd rather 
do without the vampires)

Bad trailer but good movie.Ôªø
Fun fact: vine famous marcus johns was in this (kid in the beginning)Ôªø
WARZONE SUCKED it may capture the character better but its unrealistic and 
corny,tom jane is the punisher,this film could have had more action and a 
better story,but I loved this story and I LOVED THIS MOVIE,if they do a 
reboot tom jane for the punisher,if not then Clive Owen for the punisher!Ôªø
Brilliant film and trailer largely.
But not always a good idea to show the main villain killing one of his main 
villain partners. Kind of gives part of the movie away.Ôªø
Love itÔªø
Finally watched it.  Pretty much hated this movie.  Takes 35 minutes to 
explain his simple backstory, and longer than that for him to kill anyone. 
 Most deaths cut away.  Too damn corny, not enough violence, Frank is a 
pussy here, and too much poorly done comic relief.  Typical Hollywood 
garbage.

89 and War Zone get right into the action (in quite a similar way, I might 
add).  Liked those a TON better.  89 was a good B-movie, and War Zone was 
truly amazing.  Ray Stevenson IS the Punisher.  There will never be a 
better Punisher film.Ôªø
i prefer Warzone it captures the character better and more gritty IMOÔªø
I got this m1911 guns. SocomGear MadBull M1911 PunisherÔªø
such an underrated movie!Ôªø
this movie is so underrated.....Ôªø
OMG!!! Marcus johnsüíóüíóÔªø
1:08   It's most likely something that got cut out of the movie COMPLETELY 
but what was it supposed to be?  Ôªø
I do too! I don't get al the venom it gets! To me, it's just like a good 
Punisher movie should be! The other two movies...ugh...
I like this 
Thomas Jane is the best punisher. no questions.
 They did...it was awesome.
no one dares to touch the dislike button!!!
they did 
I think they are they put out a new punisher video #DIRTYLAUNDRY so that 
might be something to do with a new punisher
Wow this is marvel?! This is such a bad movie! Am I found out in one of the 
Comics that the punisher kills every super hero and every super villane in 
marvel including himself
#DIRTYLAUNDRY was an independent project. No relation to Marvel Studios. 
That is why they made sure not to show any shots with the Punisher in full 
uniform. There was a new film (Punisher War Zone) but it was really very 
very very bad... If you want more, you'd have more fun watching the 1989 
movie with Dolph Lundgren.
That brings memories. They don't make them like that anymore. 
'' they can't kill me, i'm already dead '' * hulk falls through the ceiling 
onto him*
That project had nothing to do with any studio system. There's no plans as 
of yet for another installment. 
I wish they made another punisher movie

I like proclaiming things as certainty too that I do not know! All hail 
Sparticus!
Don't go there... 
ooooooh 60, so fucking what. I'm sure they don't just have 1 nuke laying 
around and no more. Fact is there aren't many defence protocols for a 
nuclear attack in a third world Country, it's just a fact. If you were to 
send over nukes to the US, not only would they be able to shoot them down 
(ie massive air force), but they would send nukes, atom bombs, hydrogen 
bombs, napalm, cluster bombs etc etc. If the US really wanted you gone, it 
would have happened long ago. I don't like teh US, just facts
im gonna watch this !

http://youtu.be/tVlqVHKn2dgÔªø
@Trox118 but your own sales pitch is rather shallow, so you're not 
attractive to me.
For the debate on Peeku3 and sansuke435. I mostly try to cherish 
friendship, friendship is what makes love. I don't want to rush and try the 
get a girlfriend, i just keep them as friends. I'm 14, and my plan is 
basically to keep all the girls i know as friends, i'll mature each 
friendship until i can truly without a doubt find the best match. I'm not 
very good at describing but i hope you guys know what i mean. 
I loved jen Aniston and Ben Affleck together in this movie. They had great 
chemistry
I have watched this movie a million times..LOVE IT!!! Oh, and Bradley 
Cooper is the hottest i have ever seen him in this, 
I disagree. life is about love. not looks. people kill themselves because 
of looks. never reject yourself because someone else does. when we are 
babies we will laugh and smile at anyone because all we cared about was 
that we were being loved and nurtured and whoever taught us that was not 
enough is wrong. and was wronged as well. we always have a choice. the 
truth is you need to love yourself first. more than anyone else. so that 
you never reject yourself just because someone else did. 
sorry i missed a part " no excuses in love but if they don't care, they are 
just a waste of time !!"
I Love this movie!!!
Justin Long is so freaking attractive
i know if i watch this movie i'll fall in love with jennifer connelly all 
over again....
@Sanasuke435 what a wanker Lol 
What's the song at 1:26?
guys this movie came out in 2009 if you didnt know its old, so quit with 
the stupid remarks
awesome movie :))))) "L <3 V E" it
@Sanasuke435 to be honest with ya,im sick of loving myself every nite,,
LOL, i see Jennifer Aniston in every romantic comedy film. She's great!
So Black Widow and Batman were in a movie together?
.. Mesmerized by you, Bradley Cooper! in He's Just Not That Into You.. how 
about a part ll, cont.. If I choose the man for me, YOU!
Nice movie.....Ben Affleck is so good
simplemente no te quiere :/ I'm feeling it D:
alex has a sexy voice!!!
Bradley is sooo HOT

My cousin was in this movie for about 3 seconds, lolÔªø
I just finished watching this movie just awhile ago.. And I don't know how 
many times I have cried while watching it.. Just so beautiful.. Watching 
the trailer makes me remember the story again.. It's so heartbreaking.. Ôªø
A Story well told!!!!!!   HadasÔªø
One of my favourite movies.Ôªø
I can see the parallel between this story and my personal life as someone 
with the ugly duckling syndrome. Ôªø
Happen to see this movie a year ago, still a outstanding peace of artÔªø
I realy love this movie!!! And I'm loving the words that [ Never know what 
is coming for you]!!! We have to enjoy our life more!! right?
Such a great film. Love it
Seems Legit.
It's like progeria but the opposite way
This movie honestly made me cry. I haven't seen it for a while, but I still 
remember its scenes as if i watched it yesterday. Besides the fact that 
it's brad pitt and he's just handsome attractive either way ... this movie 
was just amazing! theres no other way to put it. I bawled my eyes out.. 
that's how sad, happy, and moving it was. 10/10
This movie got me into tears. I cried and smiled. Its a masterpiece and 
also VERY touchy. Loved it! Everyone should see this one!
wat is faggots? please tell me gaylord 
My most favorite movie ever!
what's the song in the second part of the trailer? About 1:00... It's 
really REALLY great... Anyone knows?
Its decent. Pretty predictable but.
you should really go f*uck yourself u dirty lose ... not everyone around 
the world speaks english and ffor him who is trying this is a great effort 
... why dont you go learn his language for a chance ... f*cking cunt 
i smell butthurt underaged faggots
On of the best trailers :) Ah i love this movie :) 
awesome. wanna see it
I've just watched the movie,and I have been crying for over an hour now! 
This movie goes right through my heart.

It's really fascinating to look back on this. This was such a primitive 
time period for the superhero movie genre. Very high nostalgia feel to itÔªø
Michael C Hall the next DaredevilÔªø
The new Batman people...the new Batman...Ôªø
It doesn`t matter what everyone says they`re all going to end up watching 
batman vs superman.Ôªø
I enjoyed the film. poor Ben Affleck got abuse from fans just for being an 
actor in the film. if they have a problem with the movie blame the writing 
staff and maybe the director Ôªø
wats name of tune at start?Ôªø
I enjoyed this movie when it was first released.  Maybe if I watch it again 
I would see it's problems.  RIP Micheal Clark Duncan. Ôªø
Daredevil can see the future with his ears.  Wow.Ôªø
It's stupid don't waste your time!!Ôªø
Why is dumbÔªø
i wanted to hate this bad movie but i can't. it really is entertaining to 
watch. and ben affleck really wasn't bad. he was just ben affleck. the 
director's cut makes it way better. if they had just been able to clean up 
some of the really cheesy looking CGI it would have been a solid film. 
minus colin ferral's bullseye. what the hell was that?Ôªø
#8
Daredevil

So much promise,Elektra in this movie played better than her stand alone.
Wrong actress and wrong actor,hopefully they will re-boot this one.
Also have the 1960's and 1970's comic books....yeah..bias again...lol!Ôªø
Ôªø
I enjoyed it. Daredevil did fine with what he had to work with.
Not really the best if you consider the pre batman and superman actors are 
american, tobey maguire did a better job than andrew garfield (although 
both are great), chris evans as the human torch and captain america, robert 
downey jr as iron man, i could go on all day
Don't think I've actually seen this since 2003, and I remember loving it! 
But to be honest, based on this trailer, I don't think I would want to 
watch it again! It looks a bit lame! 
I'm the only one who thinks this movie is good?
Ben afflek as batman now bale as daredevil remake
This movie was a pos.
Maybe
IS DAT ELEKTRA?
Just hav Nicolas bale do it
All I have to say is he has the looks and feel of the new-52 Batman. I'm 
really tired of faggots searching up daredevil just to complain about Ben. 
Which is why I'm done commenting because I'm just looking for a specific 
scene from the movie. If you don't like Ben then don't watch Batman VS 
Superman.
you don't have to watch them.. some of us are actually waiting for a new 
superhero movie..
You guys are brainwashed if you think this softie wimpy faggot can play 
Batman. WB dropped the ball on this one.

#1: Silence
#2: Dragon
#3: Hannibal (TV Series)
#4: Hannibal (Film)

Hannibal Rising doesn't get a place.  Neither does Manhunter.Ôªø
Hulk VS OdinÔªø
HmmmÔªø
One of the best set of lines in movies ever: 
- "You have disadvantages..."
- "What disadvantages?"
- "You are insane"Ôªø
kiintoisa...Ôªø
This was the original novel but the sequel was silence of the lambs and it 
had to be better the book and why it was mad into a movie firstÔªø
Manhunter > Red Dragon. Both are good films thoughÔªø
Silence of the lambs first than Hannibal with Juliane Moore as the 
character of clarise and then. Red dragon in 2002 then later on Hannibal 
risingÔªø
"He's a bodybuilder, of course"Ôªø
okay children, here's one for you, scarier Dollarhyde, Noonan or Finnes?Ôªø
Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, Hannibal, and Hannibal Rising. Plus 
Hopkins was in The Rite. And if you meant that Lecter has only been in 
three movies, he's been in the above 4 and he was in Manhunter. That's 
really awkward.
@TheHonp Yeah, we know, we just saw the trailer aswell.
0:40 - 0:51 LOL that shut him up
Terrible trailer for a good movie...
Hannibal rising is the 4th even tho its prequel 
i am confused when dolarhyde shoots himself and then comes to grahams home, 
how did actully he did it?, very confused i am
@futuremovieactor I agree with you there. Even though Hopkins' portrayal of 
Hannibal was not exactly like the book, I found him far more disturbing. He 
was able to do something with his eyes that hypnotized you like a reptile's 
prey.
Your english will disturb Ralph.
Wait. Hopkins actually appeared in Hannibal Rising? dafuq?!?
LOVE E. NORTON!!
That awkward moment when he has only been in three movies.
What's the song at 0:06 ?
???,?
this is a great movie but it lacks the atmosphere of silence of the lambs 
and although anthony is excellent as always he lacks the menace of his 
younger slimmer self in silence of the lambs personally i prefer manhunter 
but this is great, the scene where will visits lector in the asylum edward 
norton rightly argued that an experienced fbi agent wouldn't show his fear 
of lector so the sweat under the armpits did the talking
He would have a field day.
$$$$
WMG muted an official movie trailer ? For their own movie? Retards...
yes, always and forever. You will always be remembered as the man who 
showed us how to live. As if each day we are dying.
@Sam Pointent, Straight men get aids too. And no, the gays didn't invent 
aids, it was Richard Nixon as weapon to fight the cultural events of the 
70s . Read about the "Hippie War Pasta Contention" 
It's 7 years later, and these 1:44 minutes STILL give me chills!
i cant agree more. i wish jonathan larson was still here so he could write 
more!!!
i dont know. the trailer makes me want to see this movie again because last 
time i watched it with several of my friends and we didnt even make it half 
way..it was way too boring/depressing for us. maybe it was immaturity..i 
will try to watch it again this time.
I thought my neighborhood was fuked up
When I hear Finale B every time, without fail, I get chills. I can't 
believe RENT is almost off Broadway. And I'm so far away from Broadway that 
I can't even see it. Well, there's the tour with Adam and Anthony, at 
least. Viva la vie boheme!
Fucking youtube
Ok, WMG is really stupid for muting their own trailer! But hey, I'm used to 
stuff like that. You know GEMA? I guess not, because whatever it is, it 
blocks every single video on youtube with more than 30 seconds music in it, 
in Germany. THAT is annoying. Sorry, just gotta say this, since everyone is 
complaining about no sound etc. AT LEAST YOU CAN STILL LISTEN TO MUSIC ON 
YT! Sorry, I got carried away ... anyway, I LOVE Idina Menzel and I think 
I'm gonna watch this movie just because of her :P
When i will be big, i WILL see to my soon this movie (sorry, but i m not 
england and i don¬¥t know speak englis well)
I may be biased cause this is my favorite movie, but I honestly think this 
is one of the best movie trailers of all time
what ever ok im just saying that youtube should allow the audio to play so 
youtube has a say because the WMG IS ON YOUTUBE OH MY GOD!
lol i kno its just a play but i think those people are truly the lucky ones 
for having friends tht dont judge u for anything that u are. Id kill for 
tht I luv my friends but truly these people may seem the most unlucky when 
they are truly the lucky ones.
yeah... it realy is the BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!
To be honest... I'm not a huge fan of the movie. I prefer the live 
recording instead. If you watch that then you get the true RENT experience.
it's impOssible nOt tO like it!! i lOved it the 1st time I saw it... it's 
just sO tOuching!..
what chu talkin bout TrChSpHa?!?
i am OBSESSED with rent
No, not at all. Avenue Q is a comedy and Rent...definitely isn't.
Gives me chills every time
My thoughts exactly, i watch it, like, every day or every other day. lol, 
i'm a huge RENThead.
this is such a good movie.
NOO. Adam Pascal = HOT. & he suits Roger so much better than Justin 
Timblerlake would. Personally, I think that if they had put pop stars or 
really famous people as the cast just BECAUSE they were famous and would 
make RENT more known, it would have ruined the whole thing ENTIRELY. I love 
this cast so much <3. They rock!
I love this movie. I'm a complete Renthead :)

I liked most of this movie. The main character is a little over-the-top

There is no doubt that this movie is quite good.Ôªø

i love this film with all my ass hole!!! 
You actually see a closeup of the vagina during the birth in the movie, not 
cool!
hey Britney is so hot 
Saw this film on TV ~ and have just ordered it on Amazon. It's about two 
young American couples - one married with young children and the other 
skirting round the delicate issues of responsibility, obligation, love and 
freedom - and how they react when the single girl accidentally gets 
'knocked up'.
best cast EVER <3
but but he is fat
'GET OUTTTTTTTTTTT' 
watched the movie, was really amazing
I wish corporations would spent money on informing masses about 
overpopulation problem instead of wasting them for such a retarded movies 
just to make profit on human stupidity. -_-'

How come you make a love story and don't end it with a real passionate 
kiss? In the end I was just staring at my laptop to see the last kiss, but 
it didn't happen. Motherfuckers, you make a real nice story and you don't 
show the love part at the end? Go fuck yourshelves..
I love how it was edited to make me feel like someone who was used to 
seeing pbs commercials. HAHAHAHAHAHA!

The development of Cars 2 seems to have been driven as much by 
merchandising wants as creative needs. After all, it's easier to sell cars 
than Ed Asner. Wow I really liked this movie! It is worth seeing this in 
theaters but if you want you can see him online at getfilmsnow.co.cc.
"Cars 2" is as close to a pure boys' movie as the toon studio has yet made 
-- though all boys' movies should be so universal in appeal. Hope this is 
the best place for the movie lovers, crtkani.co.cc page!
With their more elegant diction, Caine and Mortimer provide a wonderful 
contrast as his formidable new allies. wow it looks really great already! 
I'm gonna watch whole movie today at filmsi.co.cc!
@lrrejr it did come out yesterday
I LOVE LOVE this cartoon. I think it's amazing. I loved it, finish it at 
¬∞¬∞free¬∞cartoons¬∞.¬∞u¬∞s (remove all ¬∞)
@Tacom4ster Is this a joke? You are a braindead sheep if you actually 
listen to critics. THINK FOR YOURSELF! Besides REAL Pixar fans enjoy every 
Pixar film for what it's worth, the online community enjoys bashing Cars 
and Cars 2 because it's some type of bandwagon. Please, don't call yourself 
a Pixar fan.
The whine of engines and the rattle of gunfire (surprisingly frequent in a 
G-rated film) compete with the nonstop yakking to such an extent that 
Michael Giacchino‚Äôs score has to strain and blare to be heard. have to 
believe what people said. This will be good film. Watch it on crtkani.co.cc
Larry's vocal turn lifts Mater to the pantheon of endearing Pixar creations 
even as he gets occasionally gets on the viewer's nerves, as he should. 
bout to watch this for free at filmsi.co.cc :) not spam btw its a f'ing 
awesome site.
@xiTzblazinx But that's what made it funny! If Lightning had ended up a 
spy, the story wouldn't have been interesting at all-cuz he'd probably know 
what he was doing. 
Wow you spamming noobs are idiots! Cars 2 wasn't a book before the movie! XD
just back from the cinema..... this movie is amaaaazing !!! i loved it :D 
‚ÄúCars 2‚Äù is certainly built to move merchandise ‚Äî this series may surpass 
even the ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù films as an effective advertisement for licensed 
playthings ‚Äî but it is notably lacking in soul or sublimity. Watch the 
movie in full version on crtkani.co.cc Excelent movie!
With its frequent nods to James Bond and other spy thrillers, the movie 
makes sure even the uninitiated will recognize the inspiration. The action 
scenes, of which there are several, are disappointingly pedestrian, doing 
little to raise the pulse. Wow, awsome film to watch it with your 
girlfriend at getfilmsnow.co.cc.
But they (Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin and the Pixar stalwart John 
Ratzenberger, among others) are very much in the background. Most of ‚ÄúCars 
2‚Äù takes place far from Radiator Springs ‚Äî in Tokyo, Paris and London ‚Äî and 
Lightning‚Äôs racing exploits are secondary to the improbable adventures of 
Mater.im gona see it tomorrow at crtkani.co.cc. exellent film.
Little about Cars 2 feels fresh, and more fun seems to have been had coming 
up with character names than developing the story. I watched this movie few 
days ago at getfilmsnow.co.cc in great quality...
Pic allows the viewer to relax into a pleasurable groove even as its 
abundant in-jokes and peripheral details encourage the mind to stay 
actively engaged.I really liked this movie, don't really know what else to 
say. The directors and the cast did a great job. Just finished watching it. 
You can too watch it for free at crtkani.co.cc.
Handily demonstrating that the often-aggravating staples of so much 
kid-friendly animation -- nonstop banter, ethnic accents, goofy wordplay 
(mileage may vary), even bathroom humor -- can be executed with wit and 
class.At filmsi.co.cc is english version of this briliant film!
hmmm let's see, my fav movies(of this kind) are:: 1.Cars (1 and 2) 2.Toy 
Story (1,2,3) 3.Finding Nemo 4.Ratatouile(not sure if I wrote it right) you 
know the movie with that cook and his little mouse ?!
Usually, Pixar does an excellent job of representing emotion. In this case, 
however, it feels forced and the associated "message" is presented with a 
minimum of elegance (a speech about friends). BS, this movie is supposed to 
be watched in 3d. for me atleast :) Search it on getfilmsnow.co.cc.
Not a frame goes by where you can't hear Lasseter's inner child squealing 
with pleasure.Very nice movie, full at crtkani.co.cc, worth watchin more 
than once, belive me! Hilarious movie ever seen at crtkani.co.cc website. I 
really enjoyed in movie!
Wowww....Yes the visual effects are great and the action seems overwhelming 
but Pixar forgot one thing....ITS ABOUT LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND NOT MATER..we 
all love Mater but for comic relief not to make the ENITRE film a comedy 
parade....WOWW PIXAR YOU FORGOT THAT KIDS FELL IN LOVE WITH MCQUEEN NOT 
MATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mcqueen is the reason i watched the first one...yes 
Mater was funny but Mcqueen was the FRESH, ARROGANT, INTERNALLY 
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHARACTER EVERYONE FELL IN LOVE WITH...
63 ppl suck balls
@Ellement90 too much "volence"
It may be intriguing to imagine what our toys do when we leave them behind, 
but there is something irreducibly grim about an entire planet ruled by 
mass-produced consumer goods whose producers and consumers are nowhere 
around.good movie!! lots of laughs. good cast, find on crtkani.co.cc!
@mavman1994 I bet you dont even listen to the commentary tracks

Step Up 4 will be back but after watching the trailer, I guess it's not all 
in it... But hey, we still got Moose, The Robot Guy, The Pirates, Andie and 
Sean...Ôªø

Loved this movie. Thanks for uploading ^^
The music on 1.40 is 'Come Clean' by Hilary Duff which was on the 
soundtrack on A Cinderella Story.
What is the music on 1:40 ??? =(
@SamKams you're welcome :D <33
is it me or did i jusr c GAYLORD on 0:09
Hilary Duff... the only disney girl who didn't lose her head, she's still 
beautiful and not fake. Still respectful, sweet n talented. And she doesn't 
need skimpy outfits to look sexy, she's a nice girl who's sexy! And she got 
married then got pregnant.. Gotta love her. 
shit 
@AnnaAhmadi <3 <3 <3 OOOOH THANK YOU *.*
i miss hil duff!!! she's the best!!
first movie (drop the phone) second movie (drop the ipod) third movie 
(didn't drop anything) XD IF U KNOW WHAT I MEAN
why did it say gaylord at the beginning?
AUSTIN AMES!
vote up if u think this movie a cinderella story of hilary duff is better 
than another cinderella story of selena gomez
@ 1:33 okay can someone please tell me the sonq playin in tha scene in the 
movie if ya seen it . . they danced outside the party then intrumental ppl 
played a sonq tha sounded like a rockband please someone tell me a name & 
artist :D! 
@SamKams come clean by hilry duff :)
I love both A Cinderella Story and Another Cinderella Story. I own both of 
them. They're very different though. This one is more following the 
original story. The other one is more of a music/dance version twist of 
Cinderella.
go for it girlfriend call me girlfriend one more time ok sorry
this one is way better than all the other ones, with demi and selena!!!
hey do you people know any body her in youtube who has tha whole movie 
uploaded

this movie makes me think that we Africans has lost hope for us and that we 
didn't stay strong enough for battle when whites destroy us. but yet we 
love the whites.Ôªø
I have and NEVER will wear a Diamond!! AFRICA is the LARGEST & RICHEST 
continent producing natural resources such as cocoa, Palm oil ( used in 
soaps and food products in the west), Shea butter (now popular in the 
west), OIL Petroleum and crude, Gold and other minerals...but yet Africa is 
POOR, due to exploitation from White Europeans...which still occurs ( e.g 
Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, etc) and corruption!! Africa has never 
profited from the it resources...always the West (Belgium still raping 
Congo)....(De Beers company profiteering from Diamond mines while people 
and workers...children are killed)!! Europeans and the Americans treat 
their Dogs with respect ( you even take time out to walk it and pick up 
their shit...nasty)!! Yet you treat humans with complete disregard...like 
shit!!!Ôªø
this movie is nearly perfect. there are just 10-20 movies on this world 
that are better than this oneÔªø

It's a very dangerous job. many journalists died in war's like Afghanistan, 
Iraq, Georgia (when Russia invaded ) and many more modern wars.
the most touching & meaningful movie i ever seen... 
(People that havent watched this movie yet, don't read this comment). Amal, 
I know the movie was release long time ago. But this is the trailer. Yous 
said in your comment that leonardo di caprio died in this movie. You 
shouldn't do that in a movie trailer! Cant you understand that? Would you 
like me to tell you that one of the main actors in a movie you were very 
excited to watch died in the end? No, you wouldnt. That's all im saying. 
That's why I got angry. You said he died!
 beautiful movie this my favorite movie 
Leo is the best actor in the world!!!
I love this film really sad humanity
this is excellent movie
Agree with Guilherme, 'cuz only a person with humidity in the head post a 
coment of the end of the movie in the TRAILER you understand what is 
TRAILER !?
And I wanna meet Danny Archer :-) :-)
much better film then ive expected! in top 3 movies of all time
KONY 2012
Mader chod this movie is epic and I love Mituun chakraboti .. bring him back
This is the best movie I¬¥ve ever seen. Stays on the same level as LOTR 
(Avatar can be there as well), but in the same moment, Blood Diamond cannot 
be compared with those two, because of their cathegory. Well, the best and 
saddest reality I¬¥ve ever seen in any movie.

At 0:06 - 0:34 when I first watched this I didn't know that was Jeremy 
Sumpter talking!...Until he said "Come with me" and then after that it 
definitely sounded like him! He sounds a little different, though!Ôªø
That movie was so epic! If you think about it, it's kind of a love story 
between Peter and Wendy. It's as beautiful as Romeo and Juliet. Maybe even 
more! Why Wendy left Peter to grow up I'll never know. But I will NOT grow 
up.Ôªø
So much better than the cartoonÔªø
Haven't seen this since it was in theatres. Happy they used Clocks for the 
trailer though. Love that song.Ôªø
whats the name of that song i love itÔªø
what is the song calledÔªø
That feeling you get eek Coldplay comes on <3 Ôªø
Can't. Stop. Watching. <3Ôªø
Came here to hear clocksÔªø
love this movie. Wish it had a sequelÔªø
why is there scenes in this trailer that are not in the movie? :) The on 
where Hook talks on the ship to wendy about running away from home? the 
scene are not on the deleted scene either:( anyone who knows anything about 
it??
Dear Cpt Hook, please take me to the Jelly Roger. I promise I'll make your 
life less miserable. 
this looks like a prequel to Hook lol
You know, the feeling when you hear Clocks somewhere in the first parts of 
the trailer.
I remember waiting every night for Peter Pan to come to my window... <3

Like this of you knew Coldplay before this movie came out
Coming soon on VHS, hahaha :)
This one is actually better than the Cartoon. I was 5 when i watched it and 
i still love it. I DO BELIEVE IN FAIRIES. I DO. I DO. 
Clocks by Coldplay?

sometimes they put scenes in the trailer that they were going to use, but 
when the movie comes out, they have cut those scenes from the movie because

That may be true... but you gotta admit... this movie was good, and had an 
awesome plot to it too.
esto si da miedo 
If people saw this trailer it would ruin the ending if they didn't see the 
movie. I watched all seven movies in three days and I loved the whole 
series.

Between John Dillinger and Neil Macaulay from the movie Heat. Who was 
better? Both men; handsome, charismatic masterminds who were deeply devoted 
to their friends. Robbed banks wearing suits, did it with style. Johnny 
Depp and Robert DE Nero played those roles perfectly. Michael Mann directed 
both to perfection.Ôªø
One of the best gangster movies ever made
there's no point in hiding stuff ... when you hear john dillinger you 
already know what the movie is about and how the story will turn ... so no 
harm done. cheers
This looks like the untouchables
WATCH ON AGENT PURVIS, BILLY IS ACTUALLY TALIA AL GHUL DO NOT FALL FOR HER!
1:56 = badass i love this movie
Cool
Godammit so fucking sexy in that hat (odd thing to say from a 14 yr old) 
but still
Underrated, too. Depp shines when he plays the straight man.
"I have absolutely nothing I want to do in Indian." lol, this movie looks 
sick.
trailer tells waaaay too much about the plot
This Movie is one of my favorite gangster/mob movies
 yes ,,, a great movie 
the song to this trailer is "Ten Million Slaves by Otis Taylor"
the best film ive ever watched :) 
class project on someone who interests you. Everyone else chose someone who 
helped society or something, I chose Dillinger. best choice ever. 
"Were to having a good time today, we ain't thinking bout tomorrow"
Batman and Talia al Ghul
PUT SOME CLOTHES ON MISS! LOL and hes looking.
SHIT ENDING FUCK FUCK FUCK!!!

Hey, folks! Since i realy like movies and have watched many over the years, 
i thought i could share my movie enthusiasm with you. So from now on, every 
friday will be #filmfriday and i will recommend a movie to you that i like 
and that i think you will enjoy watching. So enjoy watching it and feel 
free to post comments.

So the first movie i recommend to you is "Million Dollar Baby" (2004), 
directed by Clint Eastwood. Not only is it one of my favourite boxing 
movies, it s also one of my favourite Eastwood movies.
It s a classical underdog story with a very interessting and thought 
provoking story twist towards the end.

Have fun and see you next week!))Ôªø

no shit sherlock!
what im saying is you shouldn't take the piss out of someone elses 
appearance when you haven't got a picture of yourself to show for who you 
really are. by the way, if you're going to insult someone, at least make 
the insult a good one because that was just pathetic and childish. i bet in 
reality you're a spotty faced teenager who gets pleasure from insulting 
others over the internet because they haven't got the balls to do it face 
to face. people like you make me laugh.

 bY *peter jackson*

"is a 2005 epic adventure film and remake of the 1933 film of the same 
name. Co-written and produced by Peter Jackson, the film stars Naomi Watts 
as Ann Darrow, Jack Black as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody as Jack Driscoll 
and, through motion capture, Andy Serkis as the title character. Serkis 
also played Lumpy, the galley chef on the SS Venture. Set in 1932-1933 New 
York City and the nightmarish Skull Island, the film tells the story of an 
overly ambitious filmmaker who coerces his cast and hired ship crew to 
travel to mysterious Skull Island, where they encounter King Kong, a 
legendary giant gorilla. Captured, he is displayed in New York City, with 
tragic results.
The film's budget climbed from an initial US$150 million to a 
record-breaking $207 million. The film was released on December 14, 2005, 
and made an opening of $50.1 million. While the film performed lower than 
expectations, King Kong made domestic and worldwide grosses that eventually 
added up to $550 million, becoming the fourth-highest grossing film in 
Universal Pictures history. It also generated $100 million in DVD sales 
upon its home video release. The film garnered generally positive reviews 
from film critics and appeared on several "top ten" lists for 2005, though 
some reviewers also criticized it for its 3 hour, 7 minute running time. It 
won Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best 
Visual Effects."

I find fault with the too-slow 1st parts for developing the story. Best 
stuff in this ho-hum from Jackson are where King Kong and the woman sit 
looking at ocean as if wondering about the meaning of life,  and the ending 
with its sad pathos, which were missing in the other movies. 'Beauty and 
the Beast' .  Black resembles Orson Welles..Ôªø

One of the best remakes. I've got to get a new blu-ray player so that I can

Fucking legend. 
"I love those moments! I like to wave at them as they pass by." Love him !
keira knightley and orlando bloom please come back for the next movie
Bill Nighy was awesome as Davy Jones. Amazing voice acting... and of 
course, there's ol' lovable, but conceited Jack. Who could ask for more?
Its so cool!!!! If you hate it fuck you bitch!!
7*
damn! i want get movie it's so awesome!!!
lol this is the 2nd movie, the third came out 2007 and the 4th in 2011
Its just not the same without the original cast...especially Tia Dalma 
(Calypso-Goddess of the Sea) and Davy Jones....they had the most 
interesting story in the movies...and lets face it Davy Jones was ten times 
more powerful than Black-beard. The action, and just about everything else 
was better in the original three. 
This is one of the best
Johnny Depp has officially been involved with the character of Jack Sparrow 
for damn near a decade now. Quite an accomplishment. Although, I do feel 
that Jack Sparrow has made him a tad too popular. He definitely crossed 
over a new threshold and reinvented his image playing Jack Sparrow, but 
then again it feels like every character he's portrayed since Pirates of 
the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is just an off-shoot of Jack 
Sparrow. I just feel like he's much more talented than that.
Jack: Sexy voice!!!!!!!!!
The best movie EVER <3 
second movie made at the start of 2010,tirth made after 1 year and some 
months,then the fourth one will be done in 2013 at the begining of the 
summer :() CAN"T WAIT!
no it came out 7 years ago 
Jack Turner? You mean Will Turner?
Oh...The Stranger Tide makes me reallied how much I like this one and the 
first one.
This trailer only needed one line of dialogue: "I have a jar of dirt!!"
I remember my little grade 8 self sitting here and continuously trying to 
pause the video at the scene where Jack was almost kissing Elizabeth. I 
just couldn't believe it.
dead man's cheast is the best of the seris
aye! what a clarity... wish entire film was like this.
0:33 da fuck did I just watch? XD

I think I seen this movie 2 times. Ôªø
I still love this trailer. They nailed it (no pun) with NiNÔªø
This movie is so undertated. Too bad they cancelled the sequenceÔªø
all machines are evil and google is fucking skynet 
NOW THATS HOW YOU MAKE A TRAILER!
si quiera, esta rifa mas que las anteriores esto es lo que esperaba
No Arnold No terminator
Christian Bale is awesome!!! He does awesome movies and is not scared to 
tell someone to go Fuck themselves!!! Who didn't enjoy that recording?
...i would disgree
DUN DUN DUN DUN DUN *Jizz -__-*
Is it true that they asked Moon bloodgood to get muscular for her role in 
this movie? And if so why didn't she get muscular?
i really do hope that this movie does well at the box office because 
Christian Bale said that he'll only do another one depending on how good 
this one will do. I really don't want to see a different John Connor in the 
next two because that would suck and also because I think that Bale is the 
most perfect choice to play Connor. Plus, Arnlod WILL be in this movie. His 
face will be digitally put into the movie with his voice and John sends him 
as the T-800 back in time to protect Sarah.

Dude, that actor with the last name Yelchin or Yetchen or something like 
that. This dude is gonna make some serious cash in the month of May. He 
plays two HUGE parts with two different characters for two different movies 
in May!!!! He plays Pavel Chekov in the new Star Trek and he plays Kyle 
Reese in Terminator!!!!! Talk about pressure of making an impression to 
play two big science fiction characters. The dude is gonna be a good one 
for years to come.
I have a feeling this is going to be one of the best terminator movies! 
Ironic, since Arnie isn't even in it.
what song/track is it at :037 ? please let me know
I like how smooth the robots move. And at the same time, they look very 
real. Like they actually put them together and made them act. Haha. Movie 
looks super good. And the character Marcus Wright is going to be an 
interesting role in the movie. And how come they don't listen to Connor at 
2:00 ? Isn't he the leader of the human resistance? And I really want one 
of those motorcycles...
Totally awesomeeeeee!!! =3
well techincally they did¬¥nt reveal anything most fans already know.... 
josh brolin was in talks earlier to play marcus character but backed out 
and it was already comfirmed he would play an early terminator the biggest 
twist for me will be if Arnie will appear in some way THAT "sequence!" 
should be given in theaters :P
This is going to be a gut-wrenching film (no pun intended). Just as T2 was 
to me.
i think it was the music of the trailer that made me watch this movie. lmfao
Too bad this trailer was better than the movie.

Sweet November is a 2001 American romantic drama film starring Keanu Reeves 
and Charlize Theron, reuniting the actors after their previous appearance 
as husband and wife in The Devil's Advocate. The film is based on an 
earlier version made in 1968 and written by Herman Raucher. Due to the poor 
response the film receive...

i can't wait till its on tv :)
Man I sure wish I could have been aware of this movie when it was out in 
theaters. It must have not been advertised much. But then again most of 
Keanu movies missed my radar due to this same fact. This is very deep 
movie. Took me twice to watch it all the way through because I was angry at 
first but then I think I got it. Wish everyone had love that intense. I 
have 3 in my collection now to let other watch it. I am forever glad that 
YouTube/Keandra4ever told me to watch Keanu movies. Thanks!
imagine joe pesci acting in this movie aaaaahahahaha! Just to dry all the 
tears in here!
what's the song
@diogop96 Enya - Only Time. 
Can someone tell me the title of the song?
The number of times that i watch this movie its also number of times that i

Great trailer. I don't think the movie was as high quality (perhaps it was 
too sad for me at the time), but it's stuck in mind since I watched it.

Here is the official trailer for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.Ôªø
This is my favorite trailer of all trailers! Ôªø
Dumbledore dies.Ôªø
when I watched this trailer, I thought this would be the best harry potter 
movie, especially when you saw the scene were Ron is lying on the floor. 
but when the movie came out... :( the romance and comedy was stupid. 
instead of those, they could¬¥ve made more parts at the end when the death 
eaters were at hogwarts.. :(Ôªø
I just love that dialogue at the very end. Chilling!Ôªø
"Did u no sir?Then?"
"Did I no I just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time?"
BOOM
"No."
Loved loved loved it. This whole teaser was amazing but this little part 
right here made it what it was. Ôªø
Just realised I've never seen this one.Ôªø

The trailer looks good but the movie was all about romance and Harry and 
Ginny... Some of the scenes were unwanted like when Ginny ties Harry's 
shoelace in the Burrow, like WTFÔªø

Can you hear the FartÔªø
The irony in this comment is obvious :0.
I liked this movie but it had some unneeded stuff in it.
not everybody watched this movie bud, and this is the trailer, usually 
people that did NOT watch it come here
Least favorite movie in the series, although I still really enjoyed it. 
Ironically, this was my favorite book
Um...How are sparkling vampires realistic?
You spelled 'Hermione' wrong.

This is slightly right, the Moby album it is from is named Play but the 
song is called Porcelain. 
Awesome film

The song is by "Moby." I am certain of that. I believe the song is called 
"Play." I am uncertain of that.
What's the song in the begining of video? 
what is name of the song? i love it but dont know what its called
the trailers sucked back in 2000 !

back when m.night was a good directorÔªø
very good story line. But it's INCREDIBLY slow...Ôªø
Oh shit! Doug!Ôªø
The ending of this is hilariously bad.Ôªø
My favourite film everÔªø
sequel !Ôªø
What happened shamalamadindong?Ôªø
I'd read the book..so scary to think..Ôªø
there should of been a graphic novel of this plus a mr glass prequel 
graphic novel they could of done more with this. not too much that will 
ruin it but just a little bit moreÔªø
why does this remind me of the matrix?Ôªø
The man of steel ost fits so well with this movie Ôªø
Good movie!! Syamalan is very good!!Ôªø
I enjoyed this movie so much . I think this is truly one of the best super 
hero movies made. I liked the fact that they kept David's gifts realistic 
but special. You could believe his ability's were possible and yet they 
were extraordinary. I liked that he like every other super hero also had a 
weakness . You could believe Elijah's theory was possible because it made 
sense and worked within the idea of Yin and Yang or balance in the universe 
.  The twist at the end was surprising to me, I should have seen coming but 
didn't  . Ôªø
Nothing special...Ôªø
My friend and I have been debating about what was the best film to have 
come out in *2000* for a few years now. My friend believes that 
*"Unbreakable"* was the best *2000* had to offer. I, on the other, thought 
the film was good but not worthy of the title. 

G+er's my question to you is quite simple: 
*Was "Unbreakable" the best film of 2000? If not, what was?*

For those that can't remember the flicks that came out that year click on 
the link ----> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_in_film#U-VÔªø
After much drunken debate over the weekend, I believe it was decided that 
*Unbreakable* is one of the most under-appreciated classics of the last 
decade or two. It's definitely the best Shyamalan movie thus far and I'd 
argue the best superhero origin movie.. possibly ever? Ôªø
This is my favorite Shyamalan film.Ôªø
his writing just got bad.. and awkward. he's still a good director though, 
he just needs someone else to put his ideas onto the screen with words. 
that's all you say on every movie trailer..
I can tell this must be an incredible story, Bruce being the only survivor 
in a big accident. Really now, I've never EVER heard of any movie with the 
same story line.
Each to their own, but I think Gladiator was superb. It's one of my 
favourite films ever. 
Love the cinematography work in this movie.It is truly unique when you 
notice it.
I would say .... This is the closest-to-reality superhero movie ever made! 
not overall, just in two of his movies. 
$$$$
Too cheesy for me.Ôªø
Ôªø
I love how they didn't make it about race. This could have been any mans 
struggle! Loved it! Ôªø
I loved this movie :) The ending never fails to put a smile on my face.Ôªø
I finally saw The Pursuit Of Happyness and here's my review on that and 
Will Smith. First I have to say is that Seven Pounds is still my favorite 
Will Smith performance, I'm not saying the movie and Will were bad, it just 
wasn't Seven Pounds. My biggest issue, they sucked all the life out of 
Will, we go to see Will Smith, if he's not even gonna be recognizable, 
might as well get Idris or Denzel. The movie just dragged in too many 
places but those intense moments hit, really hit! Man oh man, so much 
potential but just not there, 7.0.

Props to Will Smith on this performance, I just wanted more of him.Ôªø
this movie is one of my best movies I've ever seen Ôªø
Looks like another film that inspires niggers, just like 12 years of 
slavery.(I would of kept them in there, they would of done more good to 
society) WHITE POWER!!!Ôªø
Can anyone please explain why it is happYness, but not happIness???Ôªø
I Just Cannot Understand How Can Someone Dislike This Video?Ôªø
Pretty much the ONLY Will Smith movie I tolerate, but everything else I 
just keep thinking of Fresh PrinceÔªø
Happiness* Ôªø
I think I'm the only one noticed the spelling of HAPPYNESS!Ôªø
wittle jaden smith :3Ôªø
awesome film....will smith at his best..10/10Ôªø
That movie exsplains my whole lifeÔªø
This is such a sad movieÔªø
The message is protect your dream and don't let no one tell you can't do 
something.Ôªø
@sunnahproduction KILL YOUR SELFÔªø
i really love this movie this..this is awesome at ending part i really 
burst into happyness..Ôªø
0:50 ?? what this songÔªø
the man me walks past right at the end is the man who it actually happened 
to!!!!Ôªø
Actually George , this was a true story . You can look it up if you want . 
Chris Gardner was a real person and he wasn't lucky. He worked to have a 
better life.Ôªø
this is the movie never fails to touch me or the other guys. good job will 
smith.Ôªø
Great movie but be prepared, total cry festÔªø
love love love love this movieÔªø
$$$$
He wrestle in ROH and CZW made me like this movie even moreÔªø
great film, mickey rourke's best role as the main lead, his most underrated 
movie as a lead has to be the pope of greenwhich village, if anyone out 
there who hasn't seen it watch it great crime movie, overall a 10 out of 10 
movie, with a sad ending,Ôªø
Beautiful movie. The emotions were perfectly expressed. One of the most 
touching and inspiring movie I've seen of late. The Wrestler 4 Ever. Ôªø
Pause at 0:33. For you wrestling fans, play a game I just made up called 
"Find the Anoa'i."Ôªø
exaggerated mat sounds and mediocre wrestling pulls this movie down. the 
action is not realistic. but can be watched for the dramaÔªø
Why does it remind me of Jake "The Snake" Roberts?Ôªø
I love the wrestling yeah!!!Ôªø
booring movieÔªø
Still so goodÔªø
There is something I need explained to me BADLY: How are "The Wrestler" and 
"Black Swan" considered companion pieces?

"The Wrestler" was a drama that told a very powerful story about a washed 
up man who, while trying to find love and reconnect with his daughter, is 
trying to regain his fame while he knows he doesn't have much time left. A 
movie that makes men cry because it's so believable.
"Black Swan" is a horror film that tells the story of a ballerina who, 
under the pressure of her controlling mother, the stress of her passionate 
teacher, and the rivalry between her and a darker, seductive dancer, 
completely loses her mind and sight of reality as she lets all three 
smother her and causes her to truly unleash her dark side. A horror story 
set against an elegant world that will show you the greatest terrors are in 
your own mind.

These films are completely different in nature and genre, which makes me 
wonder how the hell they're companions. I understand their leads are 
involved deeply in different forms of art, but that's where it stops. Are 
they considered companions because they used to be one entire film? I NEED 
TO KNOW!!! If anyone truly knows, and I mean ANYBODY, please answer it for 
me.Ôªø
I WAS'NT IN TOUCH WITH MY DAUGHTER FOR 10 YRS,WHEN I SAW THE PART IM A 
BUSTED UP PIECE OF MEAT AND I DESERVE TO BE ALONE.I JUST DON;T WANT YOU TO 
HATE ME.I CRIED FOR HRS.MICKEY IS THE ONLY ONE WHO COULD PLAY THIS PART.GOD 
GAVE IT TO HIMÔªø
1:40 R-Truth :DÔªø
Jesus christ. these fucking people and their wrestling. Get it together. I 
refuse to watch this maschiÔªø
I really like this movie.  Watching Mickey Rourke however just drains the 
life out of me every time I watch it though, like he's painful to watch.  
Not that it's bad acting, not at all, but it's like this sad, empty, lonely 
feeling.Ôªø
Mr. ManiacÔªø
I'm looking for the track playing in the strip club scene where randy finds 
cassidy in the VIP. It's a fast pace RnB track.Some of the lyrics I could 
make out were.. "i got a question, if you can answer this".Ôªø
Was that r truthÔªø
What a film! It was so awesome that some of the matches where in CZW and 
ROH made it seem so real. The thing that made it feel so real also was that 
Mickey Rourke was the perfect actor for this role, when he talked about how 
he's "an old, broken down piece of meat" and those tears. It was from the 
heart..Randy the Ram 4 lyf!!Ôªø
arguably the best drama film i have ever seen. a rare perfect film from 
beginning to end Ôªø
Excellent movie.Ôªø
What a awesome movie and what a come back Mickey Rourke made from this 
movie.Ôªø
Lol this movie was a jokeÔªø
A very good film.Ôªø

Somebody just recommended Raging Bull to be in good comparison to this

I like them better when they were youngerÔªø
Scooby doo 2 is fricking spectacular
Just meet matthew lillard today, cool guy :)
This was my favorite out of all of em'
OMG I JUS REALIZED WHAT "DOO HAPPENS" MEANS!!!! Velma said Scooby's name 
means Scooby "Poo" and poo is shit so by saying "Doo Happens" its saying 
"Shit Happens" which is funny because alot (and I mean ALOT) of shit 
happens in this movie. Ha its punny in its own right. Nice one. :)
by KKK do you mean ku klux klan
whacky-ass jim carrey playing as laid back shaggy? i dont think so...
@123sweetgigimusic Yeah...the "Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated" 
cartoon...its awesome
The cast was perfect for this movie.
Velma is awesome!
lol matthew lillard was the crazy psychokiller in Scream XD
That one ghost always reminds me of the KKK
matthew lillard was perfect for shaggy. weeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!
Really? Are you dumb? The video's titled "Scooby Doo" official trailer
i love this movie but i havent seen it in ages
SCOOBY-DOO MAKES SERIAL KILLERS MORE CREATIVE!!!

Someone must have been cutting onions while I was watching this...yep, 
onions.....Ôªø
Absolutely incredible movie!!! Seriously don't let this crappy trailer put 
you off. I watched it even after seeing the trailer and it did the movie no 
good. It doesn't matter who you are, this movie is going to move you like 
you don't expect! Please watch if you're thinking about itÔªø
ive literally just finished watching the movie, its so beautiful. i haven't 
cried this much at a movie for a lonnnnng time, definitely recommend this 
to everyone :') Ôªø
this movie made me cry like a baby 2 timesÔªø
My favorite movie!Ôªø
How will smith hasn't gotten any Oscars for this or Pursuit of Happiness is 
beyond me.. One of the greatest if not the Greatest Actor in our time... 
IMO...Ôªø
Underrated movieÔªø
And so far this man has only two nominations at the Oscars and none of them 
won, so, what's the point of this! Whenever you look for recognition in 
order to demonstrate something do it at least in a game whose rules are 
clean otherwise you'll gain false titles.Ôªø
now that's how you do a trailer.Ôªø
This movie is so touching. I cried in the end but its amazing and I really 
loved it ‚ô°‚ô•‚ô°‚ô•Ôªø
Today is WORLD KINDNESS DAY!

Its a timely reminder that there are those doing it tough and for whom a 
kind word or smile really does make a difference. 

If you need a little inspiration, why not watch a clip of Seven Pounds, 
where Will Smith‚Äôs character sets out to change the lives of seven people.Ôªø
Thought provoking and inspiring movie. For anyone who has hurt/injured or 
killed someone, and felt the guilt of it eating one's soul - this film 
challenges everything. The main thing is that we can forgive ourselves...Ôªø
one of my favorite movies!!!!Ôªø
This movie is so so good...A true masterpiece like persuit of happynessÔªø
very good movie,thoÔªø
don't want to sound nerdy.. but am I the only one that noticed the 
'Heidelberg Degel'?Ôªø
Most amazing movie who agrees??Ôªø
7 Days, 7 Seconds, 7 Strangers, 7 lives, 7 acts, and the title says 7 
pounds, all of them equals to 42,    42 - 39 = 3, Half life 3 confirmed.  Ôªø
One of a remarkable movie, the movie is way better than the trailer. Ôªø
Such a beautifully moving film just amazing!Ôªø
Great movie i highly recommend it :-) their is hardly a better actor who 
suits the movie like Will S.Ôªø
The music used in this trailer is called "My name is Lincoln" by Steve 
Jablonski.Ôªø
To all those who didn't see the movie yet, I must tell you this trailer 
suck A LOT and the movie is actually 10000 times better.Ôªø
Thanks USA from France ! This is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. 
Thanks Will Smith ! <3 I love you USA ! 4 ever
$$$$
lol this remind hes hobbit role :DÔªø
this movie is so terrible it made me come here and comment so other people 
won't regret watching it ! if you read this dont see it unless u wanna 
waste 2 hours of ur life and 30% of ur brain Ôªø
what the fuck this movie looks like those old shit movies from the 1960s.. 
why is it so fucking hard to find a good outer space movie.. fuckÔªø
Douglas Adams wrote the screenplay for the film, so if you're complaining 
that the film is different from the book, it's how he wanted the movie to 
be. I like the way the film is unique from the book anyway.Ôªø
Me watching this movie: Tea - check. Towel - check. Book (to spot 
mistakes)... checkaroony. ...Reading the book... Tea - check. Towel - 
check. Movie (to spot mistakes)...
My favorite hedgehog <3
David Tennant would have been amazing at it, though I think Martin Freeman 
was still the perfect cast for Arthur. If only they could just go back and 
remake the movie but with better casing and try a little harder at comedic 
timing. Then it would have been perfect.
Awful deconstruction of hitchhiker's all Douglas Adams's misanthropy 
clinically removed for the real thing see the original BBC series 
When r they gonna make a sequel to this movie?
It is under kinda his neck in this one, but I was confused too when I first 
saw it. I think they could have cast him better
now that episode of south park makes sense
MARTIN FREEMAN YOU ARE THE MOST HANDSOME ACTOR EVER!!!
Bilbo baggins
I feel like this is a less awesome version of Wholock.......
An unspected journey to the galaxy of Bilbo Baggins
I always imagined him as one of those classic grey and blocky robots. And i 
always imagined Ford to look like David Tennant.
Disney Didn't Create That Film! Touchstone Did!
Not really what I was expecting at all, but I'll still check it out.
I always imagined Marvin as more of and R2D2 shape. I am a bit 
disappointed. 
omg martin freeman <3
Lol when he hit his head.
What happened to Zaphod's other head?
hahahahaha what
the music towards the end of the trailer remind me of men in black... irony

which one? why?

obviously didn't perfect Eragon at the least..... I could go on but I'd 
rather not.Ôªø
Somebody needs to re-do these, like a different directorÔªø
SucksÔªø
Books r way betterÔªø
i love the movie so much.

A Knight's Tale, showing at Desert Palm's Movies & Munchies tonight at 7pm

what was? http://youtu.be/zH6U5y086hwÔªø
Ôªø
And I really miss Heath ledger he was a great actor!! RIPÔªø
but that was the purpose of the movie, mixing the medieval period with 
nowadays. It is a medieval story with a soundtrack of classic rock.
I WAS THINKING THE EXACT SAME THING!!!!!!!!!
Heath is so beautiful. i love his voice.
RIP HEATH you were soo talented and good looking
I actually thought this movie was better than critics thought it was.
Ulrik von Liktenstein, spoken so sweet. (Ulrich von Lichtenstein) German is

My favorite show and game
Cool (y)
well you're a fucktard
The girlfriend is one of the most annoying love intrests in history. 
Christensen may have done a great job, but Bilson deserved a Razzie. The 
premise has been done before (X-Men, Heroes, e.t.c) And to be fair...It was 
boring at parts. I guess I'm a little too critical, and I do respect your 
opinion. If I were looking for a film that really grabs your interest and 
has a shitload of fun, I think one would be better off with Freddy v.s 
Jason.
My kindergarten play was better than Batman & Robin, so yes.
the force is strong with this one
I understand your opinion but I feel that the movie wasn't terrible. It had 
fun action, no annoying characters at least, and a cool premise. I always 
tell myself when I'm thinking about how bad a movie could be I always 
remind myself "Were you bored while watching the movie?" That's where I say 
that Jumper isn't terrible because it keeps your interest and doesn't bore 
you ever. Jumper isn't great, I know that, but it is an enjoyable time if 
you have nothing to do. B- To each is own though. ;)
could jumper really be walking among us 
shit ending
there is truth in fiction and fiction in truth.
This film is basically an account of Mace Windu's revenge on Anakin.
fucker ha ha 
lol probably better than The Room aswell. XD

What's the name of the final instrumental song?Ôªø
MAN did this one suck. R.I.P all who died in the plane crash you were taken 
before your time. But it sucks that they try to tell your story in such a 
cliche way
I just watched this movie in my L.A class and I got teary eyed
i watched this movie in school.It had a sad starting but a great ending! 
This movie makes you cry and get inspired at the same time. In the time 
when heartbreak and tragedy happens, a little hope and good-hearted people 
make something happen. This movie was fantastic. Everybody did their roles 
excellent. It is so sad but so uplifting. It gives us all a lot to think 
about when achieving dreams after the worst tragedies and disasters, I 
think every Teacher should show this movie to their students before they 
graduate. Incredible Movie!
maybe they dont like matthew mcconaughey
Matthew McConaughey sucked as the coach. He overdid it, seriously tried TOO 
HARD. This is especially apparent when he speaks out of one side of his 
mouth. This is nothing like how Coach Lengyel spoke.
Whoever disliked this video should be killed in an air crash.
This movie has some make up things well of course it is a movie my teacher 
lived in the town that this happened to and it never happened like I the 
movie just the plane crash and etc

This movie was some funny shit.Ôªø

MJ can make and "stinker" party an awesomely fun party.

HULK dancing ????
I won't make a hulk comment (even tho technically I just did) but I love 
this!! Ruflo, or however u spell his name is so stinkin cute!!
SMEAGOL GOT MOVES!
i remember my parents watching this movie when i was little. i would always 
come to watch the thriller scene. too bad i didnt know who sung it : /
And also a perfect song for the Hulk and Gollum to dance to... ;D
HULK THRILLER!!!!
DAMN! Bruce got some moves! And Elektra, dayum!
@Ez0raze Smeagol and Gollum are the same creature, just two different 
personalities. Smeagol's the nice one, Gollum is evil. So Andy Serkis plays 
both of them.
The Hulk, Elektra and Gollum are dancing to the King of Pop... magic!
Jennifer Garner made Thriller lol
Hulk and Elektra doing the Thriller, this is epic 
xD This has definitely got to be best scene out of the whole movie...
LOL one of the best dance scenes in movie history!
@JasmineDuthie so in israel =]
@GG100FDZ i do it even if people are looking!
i really want to go to the party like that :)

My goodness, they ruined the very climax of the film - what a vampire-lycan 
looks like.Ôªø
werewolfs are better howl.
Red Tape is good for this trailer !!
Bill Nighy owns in this movie. I want a remake in which Viktor wins. :D
I love when Kate Beckinsale falls down from that high and she just go 
walking like if she was going down from a step in a stair.
Œô should definetly slam Stephanie Meyer's head on the screen and ask her: 
Do you see any sparkling here?
@xAsiahooD i know i was joking :-D
Amazing movie!!! <3 it!!
red tape agent provocateur is the song :-)
@jonorocks13 a werewolf
damn these vampires r soooooooooooooooooooo cool...
best 'vampire vs werewolf' movie i've seen
Vampire team!!! 
Lucian kicks ass.
kate is awesome in this movie, i loved it
<3
kajko96 your right underworld is the best movie ever!!!!!!
wow, its been 9 years....time flies 
u know the part at the end where it goes like *way way oooh* i'm searching 
for the song all over the internet and can't find it pls tell me or i'll 
throw my keyboar out the window!
I choose the side of Selene, not the vamps under the command of kraven, 
viktor or marcus and not the lycans since lucian dies :p
who wishes the narrator with the deep voice was one of the vampires in this 
movie it would be funny as hell 
I think the trailer is not good enough for this great movie.
Im laughing so much right now, while im reading the comments that compare 
this movie to twilight. Im sorry to dissapoint you, but there is no 
sparkling xD
Today, I am.
no. no its not.

This is obviously a fake trailer, guys. Come on! Do you think I am DUMB? Do 
you really think I'm a brainless person who makes these trailers hoping you 
believe they're real? As I've said earlier (many, many times actually!), I 
am NOT trying to fool anyone and I'm not trying to make you believe that 
these films will release. What do I get from fooling you? It's just for the 
sake of editing/storytelling. I'm just making these videos and these 
trailers because I love it. I love showing you my editing skills. I wish I 
was an editor/scriptwriter in Bollywood but since I'm not, I thought why 
not just share my "talent" (I dont think I'm talented, this is what you 
guys have been telling me) with you and all the Bollywood fans. There's NO 
need to bash me and NO need to get personal. Those who leave me insulting 
messages: Don't bother, I delete everything. And to EVERYONE who has left 
these beautiful and touching comments: I CANT thank you enough, guys. I 
can't reply to each one of you, but I've read everything and I appreciate 
it SO much. Thank you thank you thank you.Ôªø

I think I have commented on this video before but recently, me and my ex bf 
were having this chat about film making and he knew I used to edit and all 
but he always called it "useless stuff" and then yesterday, he suddenly 
says - I have seen this trailer on YT which is the best editing I have ever 
seen and the girl has such a good sense of film making and she is one of 
the people who should def. be in that feild and I was very surpised to see 
this same trailer and I thought I would let you know! My ex bf, by the way, 
is an assistant director of Anurag Kyshap so I just wanna say, you have an 
amazing amazing talent and such talent just shines out!Ôªø
I took me more than one minute to realize it's a mashup. U got skills

Why not??Unless you live in a world of stereotypes....in 2000s, it's

i love this movie it's really good and funny, maybe not as good as series 
but still VERY GOOD and Samantha is the best :D

I Love It!
@CheeseySpazMan12 no its about 4 great women.....i cannot see why you are 
judging them for their lifestyle!!!
SOo much better than the 2nd. but still the tv show was wayyyyyyyyyy 
better. If you ask me, they should have only made this one, and also, they 
should have made a better storyline
so what happens to Sebastian Kydd? ;)
i <3 this show!
that's definitly NOT a movie for Guys !!
i remember when hear for the first time the real name of big...wooow john 
james preston
Just how dumb are you???
Carrie looks so damn better in straight hair thn in twisted blonde curls..!
I Love this Move but i Love Sarah Jessica Parker soooooo

Samantha is the best one. I love her one liners.
My friend Sahana (LOVE YOU GIRL) bought me this movie for Christmas, 
because she knows how much I love Sex! I've been a fan of the show, was it 
not the best show ever created? I think so! Lately, I just been not feeling 
myself, like something was off. I needed a pick me up, so finally, I got 
around to watching Sex. It left me with the same feel good feeling I got 
when I first watched it, the same feeling I'd get after each episode. Next 
week, I'm going to get around to dying my hair. I feel fab.

A Somewhat Disturbing and Compellingly Attractive Film 3.22.14

Well made and scripted.. in the tradition of early David Lynch. I refer to 
the director's use of the film's green tones, in terms of its ethereal 
ambiance in low light shooting & its overall effect on the audience

That.. coupled with background sound effects, low and constant in certain 
scenes, reminiscent of a time capsule moving through the depths of space 
(the vacuum cleaner)  

The casting was precise and first rate. Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, 
literally walk the viewer through the storyline. A convoluted maze of 
deception and dark family cover-ups

Stellan Skarsg√•rd plays Martin Vanger, and is one of the novel's 
remorseless villains. His is a brutal, unrepentant sadistic-murderer who 
kidnaps and tortures his female victims much in the manner of his Nazi 
father ..

If you are a fan of Crime, Drama, Mystery films, Girl With the Dragon 
Tattoo (2011) may be the perfect flick for a dark, cold night alone

Thought provoking & highly entertaining : Grace DeLaura

Mara was stunning.Ôªø
I watched the Swedish version last night on Netflix, and it was a drag 
listening to a different language and reading subtitles but surprisngly 
REALLY good. I wanna see this version now.Ôªø
This is one of those rare cases where than Hollywood version is better than 
the foreign version, Rooney Mara IS Lisbeth Salander, she did a far better 
job than Noomi, who for starters was an odd casting choice for this part. Ôªø
The most riveting trailer I've seen. Ôªø
What is the name of the first track in this trailer??Ôªø
Too soon for a remake I reckon, still an okay movie though.Ôªø
Why does Daniel Craig have a British accent!! The books were amazing, but 
they are Swedish so a British accent is not acceptable.Ôªø
Only when you read the books you know that Rooney Mara is Lisbeth Salander.Ôªø
Where's the sequel!? Come on Fincher! Get to work!Ôªø
 #Lizbeth  you are the best ‚ô•‚ô•Ôªø
This movie looks very interesting, but unfortunately I haven't had the 
chance to see it. Can someone please recommend me which movie I should 
watch? The original or this version? I just don't want to ruin it for 
myself :/Ôªø
Does she have Zerg Earrings? :DÔªø
One of Finchers absolute bestÔªø
the ending to this movie broke my fuckin heartÔªø
Seems like a good movie but this trailer is WAY too long.Ôªø
I never ever got to watch this movie :c . 
Im missing out on life .. Ôªø
This was one of the most intense movies i ever watched, the rape scene, the 
scene in Martin's house......had me holding mybreath the whole timeÔªø
damn that looks so fucking good. <3 love everything about thisÔªø
not gonna lie, this is an epic trailerÔªø
One of my most favourite movies of all time!Ôªø
One if the best trailers of all time. Ôªø
I just felt the need to say that those people that read the book are really 
special. Give yourselves a pat on the back. Besides that, this movie was 
epic and didn't get the credit it deserved when it came out. I'm pretty 
sure it will when the second part comes out though.Ôªø
really good movie, mara was amazing in her role, the movie was strong and 
consistent throughoutÔªø
Had me enthralled from the first scene. Great thriller!Ôªø

Movie of my childhood :*) Brings back so many memories 
That dinosaur that scared Sid reminded me of IA3.

This movie is Three men and a baby meets Shrek with prehistoric animals. 
Because this movie has 3 animals looking after a baby and the relationship 
between Manny and Sid is similar to the relationship between Shrek and 
Donkey.

Thats because you watch too-much Porno'!
j lopez s best film takes alot of guts to go into the mind of a psyco a
Tarsem Singh needs to make movies like this visually again!
Forget J-Lo and Vince Vaughn, they're really not important, anyone could of 
played those parts. Vincent D'onofrio more than makes up for those planks 
of wood. The reason this movie is so good is the art design. It truly is a 
beautiful film to watch, with scenes heavily inspired by Dameon Hirst. It 
also contains intelligent themes and symbolism. Don't just give this a miss 
because of J-Lo.
i just meet James Ryder the make up artist of this movie and i held the 
horns of the guys head in my hands it was the best feeling ever 
This was a good movie.
The cell2 is better way better
"naughty naughty worm"
This is not a horror movie.... It's like sci-fi/fantasy and psychological 
thriller. This is no Nightmare on Elm Street...
While I have seen the Nostalgia Critic's review, I still have to admit that 
I like this film. I remember first seeing it while it was in theaters. I 
was on a field trip, and the school had taken us to the theaters to see 
Rugrats The Movie. A few friends and I snuck away from the group and saw 
this instead, and our minds were blown. Watching it now after I've grown up 
a bit, I understand that most of the psychological elements are contrived 
and under - developed, but it's still a fun film to see.
It was very well-done. I agree.
wow... lots of different opinions on this movie... I don't know if I should 
watch or not...
"Facing inner demons" really? Just kicking "the evil Carl" in the face and 
ripping his nipples isnt confronting your inner demons. Symbolysm is not 
bad and the visuals are awesome but you have to have good characters and a 
compelling plot so you can have a nice movie. Just throwing us some 
religious imagery and expecting us to buy it is insulting.
This is a HIGH QUALITY horror movie, has limited but top notch scenes, 
impressive and surely a movie like this is not released every month. This 
is classy UNIQUE!

the leader is based off the teacher at river hill high school in maryland.. 
I actually went to school there and he would be teaching me now, but i 
moved.. fuuuuuck. true story
in this movie ben's graded paper is a 97% but the trailer shows 100% mind 
blown
So basically they dragged a bunch of battle hardened market hawkers from a 
random asian market and called them card counters 
98 people dont like playing Black Jack
Stu Ungar was beating blackjack at casinos and they kicked him out, so he 
had to stick to beating everyone at poker... the casinos aren't gonna let 
anyone hav da advantage
mickeys a douchebag
ok I will go back. See ya
OMG! i cant find the movie !! im searchin on 21 and videos but not a single 
one is this one!! 
I honestly couldn't finish watching this movie, the main guys american 
accent was just so fake.
very underrated film
@homestarrun Maybe 21 and The Last Casino are based on the same true story.
I believe the producers of this film said they would have included more 
Asian actors, but they couldn't find proper ones who wouldn't bust their 
banks.
Great film
keyser soze 13 year latter.
@jomojorojo no but why is this important? you sound mildly racist
Whats the commercial song?
true, I noticed that too
@homestarrun No it was based on a book called Bringing Down the House
Well thank God they didn't give away the whole movie in the trailer!
Isn't this based on "Bring Down The House", the book?
I have this movie on DVD and I like it. I like the beginning part of this 
trailer. Is anybody here really skilled on Blackjack? Ohh, I'm sure I can 
beat ya.

im a wee bit confused as to what the fuck i just watchedÔªø
one of the best movies i've EVER seenÔªø
How is this confusing to people? Wife suspects cheating, hires an escort to 
out the husband, escort gets too emotionally attached and probably becomes 
a danger.Ôªø
Cool. Watching this tonight.Ôªø
What the.........Ôªø
This is an excellent film.Ôªø
gungaÔªø
(Spoiler alert! ). ...very simple story for a simple movie




the ending is everything chloe said is not true and all the doubts of the 
wife are just imaginations his husband never cheated on him..Ôªø
where can i find this movieÔªø
worst movie I have ever seen. No logic, no story.Ôªø
Does anyone know the song that is played in around 69th minute of this 
movie ? please..Ôªø
Liam ‚ù§Ô∏èÔªø
if amanda seyfried wasnt in this movie i wouldnt watch Ôªø
I always be like "OMG! Gemma Wards" and then like.... nah.... Amanda 
Seyfried...Ôªø
Liam Neeson suckÔªø
This is a SPOILER, so go away. I think would have been amazing if Chloe and 
Katherine ended up together. I mean they look good together, and Katherine 
said she liked it when they made love, and besides her husband was a total 
joke and her son was a fucking cunt. She could have easily left them and 
gone with Chloe. Chloe actually loved her even if her actions might have 
showed otherwise. But either way the last clip of the movie with the 
hairpin made me content so the ending was alright.
I love this movie... But for me was pretty admirable that Natasha died in 
the middle of Liam's shooting and he came back like in few days to ended 
it... I know you need to be professional when something like this happens, 
but still.
the first question about this movie is how did catherine found the strenght 
to refuse to amanda :D but no jokes - the movie is great in my opinion, it 
shows very common family issues and at the same time very different unusual 
emotional drama that is usually not accepted by our community. Plus, I 
think that Amanda is SUCH talented actress, she expresses feelings (that 
make her feel awkward in real life) as if they are her own. I totally 
admire that!
She's trolling, obviously.
I've watched this film, and I really liked it. So intense, and erotic! But 
I'm just confused, why did Catherine wears Chloe's hairpin at the end? Did 
she fell in love with her too? :-/
Jon, that is what they took that from, they based on Nathalie
then every man on this planet would go fishing! you cuntface !
she didn't said 100% fucktard !
are you a cunt or,a troll ? 
Right,but cloe didnt want to ruin the marriage either,she just was soo 
lonely,she never got love from anyone,but the poor girl thought katherine 
was a good woman and cared for her,but katherine had her own life,though 
she enjoyed making out,thats selfish though..No one ever loved chloe,every 
men just used her for sex,she was a lonely soul,thats why in the end she 
intentionally died..frustated with life..

i love love love love this movie so much!
great movie :)

"We bury our sins here. We wash them clean!"Ôªø
this movie is so underrated.Ôªø
Kevin Bacon is badass in thisÔªø
Does anyone know what the song starting at 0:45 is? Ôªø
the best Clint Eastwood-directed movies, Sean Penn is great!!!
Don't listen to him, he probably likes stupid shit with a lot of 
explosions. This movie is brilliant, and Sean Pean was extraordinary!
I'm almost done reading the book. I'll probably check the movie out. (:
one of the best drama movies ever, i cried at many parts of the film, it 
was the only one which really touched my heart :(
Kevin Bacon's two well thought out movies are Mystic River, and A few good 
Men
i'm confused
@lachlanSB haha. awww so you have a heart? r is it just gas? lmao jk! yes 
it is very sad! :(
the ending was crazy
By far one of the best movies I watched.
one of the best
oh
@Melieb90 I'm a guy who doesnt get really touchy feely sort of thing, but 
whe i saw that it brought a tear to my eye.
terrible movie, i wonder how they managed to fuk up so badly, trust me, 
this movie is a waste of 2 hours
oh
Probably one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.
1 dislike make me sick 
mystic movie ever
Great film

Day 8: Your favorite Hollywood remake.

I love a good caper. It usually starts off with a rag tag team of misfits 
getting together. Then the leader has a cleaver plan so no one gets caught 
or hurt. When a caper film is done well it will keep you on the edge of 
your seat while setting up a number of twists and turns to fry your brain. 
The remake of Ocean‚Äôs Eleven is a well done caper and my favorite Hollywood 
remake.
The characters and the big setup in Ocean‚Äôs Eleven can be explained in one 
word, cool. On top of that the movie is really funny when it needs to be. 
Thrills, misdirection, and laughter, what else could you want from a movie? 
Give Ocean‚Äôs Eleven a watch if you haven‚Äôt already and if you have, watch 
it again. I‚Äôve watched the film over and over again and is still incredibly 
entertaining. 

-BrianÔªø
12 and 13 aren't as great as the first, but they're fun.

The best film ever!!!Ôªø

this...is what jedi knights should really be like.Ôªø

Fanning's skirt was WAY to long... HUHM /sarcasm ofÔªø
best movieÔªø
does somebody know a good thriller like "runnig scared" Ôªø
Trash. "The Golden Man" (Next), "X-Men", "Firestarter" and "Scanners" 
pressed together in one movie.Ôªø
this movie was so freaking bad. chronicle was WAY better.
1:38 I KNOW !!!! lol
I hoped it would've had a sequel, I enjoyed this movie.
That awkward moment when you realize the guy in this movie is Captain 
America.
muito bom esse filme
---------------------- Spoiler (I guess?) ---------------------- I'm 
guessing Cassie had plan it all along that she's going to die. She's just 
pretending or thinking that way so that the "Pop Girl" would see it that 
way instead of the "Pop Girl" actually losing her memory. Am I right? Or 
they actually said it in the movie and I wasn't just paying attention? xD
just like tv show heroes
@louisels going to be? It come out a few years ago
1:38 >:D
this is the movie that made me fall in love with Dakota Fanning haha <3
"There is only one person who has escaped Divison?" anyone else thinking

this movie is a masterpieceÔªø
320p.... is not HQ. Amazing movie though Ôªø
amazing movieÔªø
oh my god i love this movie. 
Learning about the depression in my class right now and we watched this it 
is now one of my favorite movies.
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. It is a true story of 
incredible hope and faith about how much a man loves his family and will 
sacrifice everything to provide for them. This is a positive and 
inspirational movie that was not nominated for best picture. Look at the 
acadamy award nominations for 2005 and draw your own opinions. I will never 
watch the acadamy awards. Hollywood should be ashamed. 
The epic finale against the giant champ Primo Carnera means even more when 
you see the real Carnero. He starred in "Hercules Unchained," his last 
movie role as a Greek giant fighting movie muscleman Steve Reeves, who was 
the biggest hero in movies at the time--and Carnero dwarfs him! See how big 
and menacing Carnero really was. The movie can be viewed at Flixhouse (dot) 
com for free.
Could someone please tell me, what is the name of the song at 1:48- 2:20?
Definitely one of the best 10 movies ever made.
another RUSSELL CROWE RON HOWARD COLLABERATION also PAUL GIAMATI looks great
Why did he fight? For milk. Yes, he did fight for his country. He fought so 
everyone could have milk.
Without a doubt the greatest movie ever.
@schuf1 I know, this should've cleaned house with Oscars. Amazing movie.
The word determination just doesn't cover it. So many people are down now. 
So many guys are just looking for an opportunity. 
@schuf1 is so deserved an award, unfortunately its hard to get awards when 
your movie has real truth and beauty in it though. This movie changed my 
life
I saw this in my class, its the best movie i've ever seen, the whole class 
was cheering on for jimmy. it was awsome.
This film..you need to watch it just after watching never back down.
Such a movie beast movie
Is anyone seriously going to claim this wasn't an Oscar-worthy performance

Who sings the oh no song?
such a good movie! 
Can someone please tell me the song at the end?
I think if the friend knew how she felt in the beginning she wouldnt have 
gotten involved and respected her sister. Problem is she had her head so up 
her ass she didnt notice how obvious it was lol
I need to see this, I hope she has a VERY happy ending
so glad i watched the movie first, this trailer actually gives so much 
away..
OMG JAMES MARSDEN IS HOT!!!
The film is way much better then the trailer. :) One of my favorites
i want a friend like her :) 
Yeah, so why did they name his character...Kevin :-(
wow.. spoiler alert.... 
He is such an underrated actor! :) But, he's amazing <3
Katherine looks SO different in this movie

"You've assembled a crack team chief..."

"it's CAPTAIN you fucking idiot!"Ôªø
I have been looking for this for the longest!Ôªø
That time Black Widow and Captain America stole answers to the SATÔªø
isnt this like 10 yrd old? explains the good actorsÔªø
Isn't this based on the book Hacking Harvard ? seems exactly like itÔªø
There were some clips in there when I thought "This is why she has red in 
her ledger" and "oh look she always wanted to kick ass". And the "you 
assembled a crack team chief" is just too easy.Ôªø
lmao how scarjo wanted to be someone who looks/acts alot like black widow. 
She must be psychic o.oÔªø
The time Scarlett actually did become a kickass woman with a cool suit.Ôªø
Scarlett got her dream job!Ôªø
So Black Widow wants to be....Black Widow?Ôªø
I take what i said back, i never knew this movie was that old.Ôªø
Ahh Chris and Scarlett are in a movie together again and this time they 
might end up together! :D
Although I'm cool with Black Widow x any other person except Fury. Ôªø
trailer has more than 7m views this movie looks garbageÔªø
undeniable proof the universe wanted the avengers to happenÔªø
btw the answer to the first problem was 10 you find it by 
100(items)/480(minutes)=.2083(amount of items made per minute with all 15) 
then .2083/15=.0138(units made in 1 minute by one person) 
then .0138*6=.083(amount made per minute by new batch of people) then 
50(half of 100 first made)/.083=600minutes or 10 hours(this is because when 
you divide the two it is basically telling you how many times .083 needs to 
be multiplied before it can reach 50)Ôªø
Black widow and captain America!Ôªø
i lived in a country where we didn't have SAT but now that I've taken it 
its kinda sad if you actually struggle with that kind of exam...Ôªø
GUYS STARTING AT @0:28 what is the title of that song?Ôªø
It's so funny to watch this film, when even the task that has been shown in 
the trailer, is not that hard, I'm in 11 grande, and last year we were 
solving that kind of tasks. Maybe americans are not that smart?:DDÔªø
No wonder Steve and Natasha are so close..Ôªø
So many actors and they were all so young!!!Ôªø
eh guys, quit chatting, and get back to work...Ôªø
cool. looking forward to this :))Ôªø
I love this movie :DÔªø
trailer the perfect score//....

i wanted nick dead ... fuckÔªø
It's actually a really nice movie but with a morose ending, but the good 
thing is that I didn't expect that it would happen, anyway, I was expecting 
some people to die, but they didn't and this is what irked me when I came 
to know that it just won't happen in the movie.Ôªø
does this remember anyone of the Christopher dorner thingÔªø
Spoiler Alert: wait wait wait, he fights to end corruption and the thing 
that gets him in the end is corruption? Da fuck is this suppose to teach us 
we break some rules and all is well? Fuck Jaime Foxx and his corrupt lawyer 
ass. Ôªø
EPIC MOVIE :*Ôªø
For those of you who haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it.Ôªø
Just watched the movie and thought "did this movie just advocate to 
overlook certain rights of people"? The ending just proved it, the cops 
when they tried to stop the antagonist had to breach certain rights of his 
in order to do so. Shit that's what the Gestapo did when they tried to 
incriminate people. The ironic part most people fell for this bullshit.Ôªø
This movie was like, ate it's fuckin words. FUCK JAMIE FOXX. \m/Ôªø
one of the best movie everÔªø
I thought it was the most badass anarchy apology movie ever 'till that 
stupid end! Ôªø
Highly entertaining movie, but it felt like they cut out a lot of important 
parts in the middle. Less drama, more action so to speak. I also agree that 
the ending were unsatisfactory, felt like a quick wrap-up.Ôªø
superb movie....Ôªø
Looks great, massive spoiler though! Ôªø
Amazing movie ! But the ending suxÔªø
ending sucked ... clyde shouldve killed them all and lived ... Thats 
justiceÔªø
he was in the right

fuck jamie foxxÔªø
best shit evaÔªø
Fucking awesome trailer! The movie as well.Ôªø
One of the most underrated movies ever IMO...
The end could be dif but overrall this is a masterpiece!Ôªø
Wher can i watch this movie??Ôªø
They need at least an alternate ending...AT LEAST!!!Ôªø
Relase me.Or what?     Or I kill everyone .....Ôªø
i hate jamie foxx with passion after watching this movieÔªø

It is a pretty good movie. Anna is so funny.Ôªø
Hi residents, we now have "Frozen" on DVD and Blu-ray! You can stop by the 
office and check it out!Ôªø
Olaf is soooo funny especially the scene with the trolls I died laughingÔªø
0:17, you could see original evil elsa :DÔªø
I like the movie except is it a movie or a song sometimes i get confused.Ôªø
I like how this trailer makes it seem like Elsa is the bad guy...Ôªø
1:41 that was not in the movie.Ôªø
welcome to the movie which has most deleted scences, most unfinished plots 
starring forever alone anna a snowman who only purpose is to make it 
funnier and the wickedly talented adele dazeem #honest #trailer  Ôªø
Guess im guna see what all this let it go crap is about...Ôªø
Dan was a liar, Anna is Gossip Girl!Ôªø
:DÔªø
This movie sucks ass.Ôªø
Reminds me of Narnia...
What is the song before that; Oh oh oh oh oh-oh Oh oh oh oh oh-oh.... That 
song from the beginning of the trailer isn't 'Harlem' but I can't find it :(
would have been cool if they didnt spoil that it was her sister? what a 
huge spoiler, ruins the run of watching that part.
Can't wait!‚ô•
Cant wait! :)
And I thought Tangled was my only favorite CGI movie.
What is this song called, 1:54
greet Demi Lovato - Let It Go :)
Awesome, but um... Quick question ....just wondering is there signing?
$$$$
if you like this check out beyond the black rainbowÔªø
This gives me little information about the plot of the movie. Ôªø
Reminds me of the movie Species Ôªø
Wow. I just saw the movie Enemy with Jake Gyllenhal. This is the next one 
on my list.Ôªø
first - I don't know if I want to watch it, because I am not a fan of 
'scary' movies
second - is that woman sleeping anytime? how many movies this year she 
appears in?Ôªø
The Kubrick quote makes me angry.Ôªø
This trailer I so Kubrick-like.Ôªø
Meh doesn't look like my kind of film.  I will however skip to the nude

this movie looks fucking amazing....Ôªø
I love a challenging film, I'm up for this

Gotta love those movie trailers where once your finished, you still haven't 
the slightest clue what the movies about. Ôªø
*Under the Skin*

After being the voice in Spike Jonze', "Her" Scarlewett Johansson follows 
through with what looks to be another thought provoking sci-fi flick 
titled, "Under the Skin".

Ôªø
*"Johansson plays an alien on earth, disguised as the perfect aesthetic 
form of a mesmerizing woman."*

I. Am. So. In. Ôªø
Very intriguing ~ Johansson has been on a roll ~ emerging at the top of her 
game...Ôªø
To everyone genuinely interested in this film: know that people will 
obnoxiously laugh at how it's "weird." Fortunately, there is a moment about 
halfway through when they shut the fuck up and realize just how messed up 
it was that they even thought of laughing. That is an incredibly satisfying 
moment. It's like that PT Anderson interview when he talks about seeing a 
showing of Boogie Nights at a college.Ôªø
I did like Sexy Beast though, so this may be worth watching. her accent is 
horrible though. I find it hard to believe that unsuspecting men had not 
recognized her.Ôªø
the girl with the dragon tattoo?Ôªø
Full nude Scarlett Johansson.... Yes please. :) Under the Skin - Official 
Trailer (2014) [HD] Sca‚Ä¶: http://youtu.be/NoSWbyvdhHwÔªø
So it's like Species?Ôªø
The thing that sucks about this is that so many people have already seen 
it, that the whole movie has been spoiled on message boards like IMDB... 
The ending is actually shown IN the trailer which I won't spoil for anyone 
unless they ask...I know how the entire movie plays out, and while watching 
it may be more fulfilling ...I can honestly say, I'm not in love with how 
it plays out and ends...Ôªø
the winter soldier?! 1:35Ôªø
Where can I watch this?Ôªø
Scarlett's on a roll.

#ScarlettJohanssonÔªø
What a crappy looking trailer.  I bet it's another extremely slow art film.Ôªø

Probably one of the most inappropriate movies of the 2000s. Some scenes are 
more like porn, and it definitely shouldn't be watched with younger 
siblings. But it's funny as hell. Love this movieÔªø
This perfectly sums up my Bitcoin trading.Ôªø
I just finished watching it.Fun for the whole family.Ôªø
"Hey Leroy!!"
"whAT"
"Your momma...she calling you meh"Ôªø
I don't often say this but this is a perfect trailer. Doesn't give anything 
away but at the same time it's so well put together and enticing enough for 
you to want to watch it. Ôªø
good pick of a song for the trailer , no really :3Ôªø
one of the best performance by Di Caprio!!!
he became one of my favourite actor ever...
Somebody must give him the  Oscar !!Ôªø
This is 3 hours long. What on earth actually happens in it? It doesn't look 
like there's any sort of plot from the trailer.Ôªø
A wonderful adventure for the whole family.Ôªø
I didn't expect that but I laugh a lot!!! And idk why but The Wolf of Wall 
Street reminds me of the movie Blow with Deep.Ôªø
DISGUSTING TRASH SHOULD BE RATE XXX
Ôªø
Ya'll keep talking about Leo, but what Jonah Hill? That dude is underrated. 
Every movie he's in, he always delivers. Ôªø
Leonardo deserved the Oscar and here's why:

I recently saw Dallas Buyers Club and The Wolf of Wallstreet. Although they 
were very different movies, the roles were somewhat similar. Struggling men 
going through a rough patch in life. don;t get me wrong, "Ron" on Dallas 
Buyers Club was an interesting and very difficult role, but Leonardo's 
character was was far more diverse. "Ron" was the same ol jackass the 
entire time, while Leonardo played happy, sad, aggression, addict, drunk, 
rich, poor, sex-driven, money-hungy, low-life, romantic, and ol jackass on 
top of that. His role was phenomenal, and that's why Matthew McConaughey 
didn't deserve to win for Dallas Buyers Club. I respect both come come fuck 
on, Academy! Leonardo DiCaprio is timeless.Ôªø
Well, I just watched The Wolf Of Wall Street. On a Scorsese chart of 1 to 
10, with Raging Bull and Goodfellas and The Departed as 10s, and the 
indecipherable mess of Shutter Island as a 1, The Wolf Of Wall Street is a 
5. Right in the middle of the pack, along with films like Hugo and Gangs Of 
New York and After Hours. There isn't much to say about it, other than it 
is the most profane movie I've ever seen. There seems to be an f-bomb every 
five seconds. I'm pretty hard to offend with f-bombs, but if you repeat any 
word over and over, it gets annoying. If you sit here and say "spoon" every 
twenty seconds, I'm eventually gonna ask you to stop saying spoon. The Wolf 
of Wall Street needed to stop saying fuck. It's basically a black comedy, 
and a few scenes are very funny. There is a reason the supporting cast is 
made up of comic actors like Jonah Hill and Rob Reiner and Ethan Suplee. 
But three hours is far, far too long for a black comedy. I can't recommend 
this movie to anyone other than fellow Scorsese completists.Ôªø
mmm mmm mmm ooooooooooooaÔªø
I just watched the movie,and it was fucking hilarious. This movie became 
one of my favorite comedy films along with Project X and Ted.Ôªø
What A fucking Movie 5*****Ôªø

I thought this was just meh, when i first saw it. Then i watched again and 
now i love it. Ôªø
This is one of the best movies I have ever watched.Ôªø
but why this movie talk about arab with bad way its a racismÔªø
great trailer I was so hyped to see this and wow it was so freaking boringÔªø
One of the most boring movies that I've ever watched. The movie was 
extremely overhyped, but it actually lived up to its name. This movie has 
HUSTLED millions of dollars out of people only to put them to sleep 20 
minutes into it.Ôªø
0:33 song?Ôªø
Christian Bale is just a mediocre actor... the rest put on a great 
performance and the ending sucked !!!Ôªø
excellent acting but extremely boring. classic over hyped film 5/10Ôªø
okay WHAT THE FUCK, critics say its the best movie ever, half of you say it 
completely sucked and the other half say it was made by god himself, can 
somebody say what the fuck is going on is it worth watching or not?Ôªø
This movie was just okay. I hate to admit it because I love all four of the 
main cast but it just wasn't great. Something was missing.Ôªø
WOW TERRIBLE MOVIE. only good part was the beginning with the hair piece. 
THAT'S IT. I EXPECTED BETTER FROM THE CAST.Ôªø
I thought it was a bit too long and a bit too boring. There is a mistake 
too! In the room where they interview the police boss, (the bald guy Richie 
beat up with the telephone!) there is a clear shell cassette in the tape 
recorder. This would not have been around in the late 70s. Clear shells 
were more common in the late 80s! The correct tape would have a plastic 
shell wit a paper label. That would have been more authentic! A TDK D or 
Maxell UR would have been a great choice from this period!Ôªø
I'm disappointed Amy Adams got on the sex kitten bandwagon. But that's 
Hollywood, i guess.Ôªø
@ Paul n. Thank God for bootleg! LolÔªø
Just rented this movie, Two thumbs up, must follow the movie close and 
understand hustles and conmen.  Great twist that I won't give away, I will 
buy this movie for my personal collection! AGAIN two thumbs up!Ôªø
This movie mas meh. Way too over hyped. It was long and boring. The acting 
was good but meh. It was one of those stories that aren't really that 
interesting. And I saw it on blu-ray. To be honest Amy Adams doesn't look 
so good in HD.Ôªø
In the days of my youth i was told what it means TO BE A MAN. Oh Good times 
Bad timed- Led ZeppelinÔªø
I also think it's because I've seen so many films like these, where I said 
to myself, "Wow never saw that coming." So I've become so on guard to 
what's real and what's not that I just lose the story line...because it may 
be more simple than what I'm creating it to be. Does that make sense? And 
yes, Hollywood has to keep re-creating the "maze" so to speak to keep you 
involved so that at one point people go, "Wow didn't see that coming". Well 
it's all become way to complicated for me. Too many characters to keep 
track of. The "maze" keeps getting bigger and more complicated to become 
more deceptive to the audience in a way. But the acting was awesome. 
Jennifer Lawrence was a "hoot and a half". One of my favorite lines from 
Amy Adams was "you're nothing to me until you're everything." My stepfather 
is so good at seeing ahead of what's going to happen. Most likely because 
he's a great con artist himself. Shhhh.....Ôªø
So this must be phase 1 of the DC-MARVEL shared universe with batman, 
mystique, rocket racoon, hawkeye and lois lane?!
oh my god this is perfect
Bo Cleary from S.Boston @ the 1:10 mark...Nice! They shaved his head..:/

Excellent movieÔªø
How did Matthew McOnnahey (probably mispelt) win best actor oscar and 
Chitewel, he was by far the best lead actor in any type of movie I have 
seen since probably Shawshank Redemption. I know the academy want to keep 
the awards winners diverse in the movie they were in, but if they were 
honest, 12 years a slave would have won most if not all the awards.Ôªø
Probrably the best movie i've seen in my entire life. I felt so many 
emotions (Happy,sad, and of course MAD!)Ôªø
Really sad to see racism in the comments and ignorant remarks. Such a great 
movie, no matter what race you are. If this movie was shown to the north 
and West coasts during the 1800's, I believe slavery would've ended sooner. 
Sad, but it's history. Respect it and learn from it. Ôªø
 
Racist like to mention that blacks owned slaves rather than address the 
horrors that happened in the South. One source: " In most African societies 
where slavery was prevalent, the enslaved people were not treated as 
chattel slaves and were given certain rights in a system similar to 
indentured servitude elsewhere in the world."  Africans never went to 
America and had no idea that the slaves would be killed, tortured and raped 
by whites. Africans didn't look at slaves as property.Ôªø
This movie made white people like bad & weird as fuck .Ôªø
Regardless of the fact that it's a very sad story and a shameful part of 
history, I think this movie is immensly overrated. I mean I was 
disappointed when I saw it at the movies. Ôªø
yeaaa yeaaaa pleasee lets do many movies like this to shit black ppl
they are slaves and they sust be like that foreverÔªø
boring movie...too long..doesn't get to the point and skips scenes to one 
place to another.. characters staring for 20 minutes doing nothing, while 
everyone is picking cotton. brad pitt threw me off completely. 3 minutes of 
heroism. he should be banned from producing movies. it would be much better 
if it was done by the book Ôªø
Great movie, watched it while my son was in school to make sure it was 
suitable.  Don't think I'll be letting him watch it any time soon though, a 
little too brutal for his age.  He's still having nightmares about 4 Little 
Girls. Guess I should have previewed that first too, didn't think they were 
going to show the girls' bodies.Ôªø
Amazing movie!Ôªø
This might be bad to say here, but Lupita Nyong'o is sexy as hell. Ôªø
I would kill myself before I am a concubine or a slave. Fuck That!Ôªø
I just watched. Very dull and wordy film, and pathetic too. Political 
correctness it is nominated for an Oscar. Much better Django and serial 
film Roots. Crocodile tears over the fate of black people population of 
America.Ôªø
-A message comes not with words but with actsÔªø
Read the book, and am so pleased that a motion picture has been made based 
on the true story. Cannot wait to see it!
this movie might be this best thing to come out this year. Steve McQueen is 
such a great director and Fassbender what a great actor 
That's just stupid,you have white people in Africa and they call it their 
land south Africa,ever heard of it!
I don't understand how White people in America can tell me and my people to 
forget OUR history. It's not like you're paying for what your ancestors 
did. The most you experience is being called racist , compared to what this 
person went through? That's like rapist blaming the victim for what 
happened to them. When people are honest and say yes this happened, that's 
when the victim will be able to move past it, not acting like it didn't 
happen.
Yes, just like they were offered 40 acres and a mule, just like they were 
offered FREEDOM minus equality under the law! I want to give YOU a chance, 
here and now, to stop making dumbass comments ...but I guess YOU will just 
carry right.on churning them out like a cow munching wet grass and manuring 
an open field ...won¬¥t you?
I can't wait to see this movie.. It gave me chills just watching the 
trailer!!!
"Any one who treats his fellow man as less than himself shall burn in hell 
for all eternity in penance for his crimes against humanity." That is the 
new scripture.
Will Smith is cool
Can you imagine if people said we shouldn't make holocaust movies because 
"it's done get over it"
Stop with this "white is this black is that" I am neither but this is an 
important part of history that we must learn from. Stop fighting each 
other. Im 2013, we still have a different view of white and black. We are 
all brothers and sisters. And we cant't change history but we sure can 
change ourselves. I am human, like the rest of u.

#Thor is back! The trailer for Marvel's #ThorDarkWorld is LIVE, exclusively 
from YouTube‚Äôs #GeekWeek! bit.ly/1750vdU Check it out now!Ôªø
The ending saved the movieÔªø
why they show eather (in tradition was the spirit of 5 elements) as bad 
thing? thats really suspicius..Ôªø
I just realized that Malekith's voice was different in this than the movieÔªø
Totally ruins nordic mythologi.Ôªø
Malekith was cool character though,,,Ôªø
i fell asleep watching the trailerÔªø
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help, I mean Hulk, Iron 
man, Captain America, you could have called any of them yet you choose the 
one person you can't trust.
Thor: Actually now that I think about it you're right! *Walks away*
Loki: No, come back! I was only joking! Ôªø
First movie Thor was million times better than this one. Dark world is so 
boring...Ôªø
How come nobody else has pointed out how ANNOYING Kat Dennings is in this 
movie. Not to mention, unfunny!Ôªø
Those of you who want real Nordic mythology must see Valhalla!!Ôªø
After meeting iron man in the avengers I feel like thor got more of a sense 
of humorÔªø
IM TOTALLY GOING TO WATCH THISÔªø
Shit*Ôªø
Horrible script! Even those awesome actors couldn't save it. Worst Natalie 
Portman performance I must say. Her little comedic effort was just 
cringeworthy. Ugh!Ôªø
Can someone please explain to me why the Thor movies insist on removing the 
fantasy aspects from Thor and replacing them with Science Fiction. I mean 
they literally had Asgard protected by a force field and laser canons, 
while the Dark Elves flew around on space ships. Worse they actually have 
Odin say that they aren't gods. Its like they aren't even trying to follow 
the storyline for the character.Ôªø
This movie was shallow. It didn't have a clear objective, just stuff 
happening. It kind of felt like a shitty episode from some tv show.Ôªø
Jane looks like an older KatnissÔªø
Love Thor but i think this movie is only ok. Ôªø
I can tell by the trailer that this movie was shit! I put it at the top of 
my queue on Netflix. Is it even worth it? LolÔªø
Movie is better than iron man 3Ôªø
The ending to this movie wow omg you really won't see it coming Ôªø
I can't believe this movie is already out on DVD i didnt even hear much 
about it either i feel like it was only out in theatres for like 3 weeks 
hahaÔªø
Worse movie I have ever seen marvel should tried harder to make the movie 
great because they really fail on this one I wastr my time watching the 
movie sucks and I mean sucks Ôªø
this movie sucks. Its a movie for feminists and one of those sequels that 
totally suck and are made with one purpose in mind, to cash in on THOR fans 
and previous movies which were decent compared to this piece of shit.Ôªø

 #matthewmcconaughey   #oscarbait   This I really want to see! this movie 
opened this week in limited release  not here yet but I have heard 3 
rapturous podcast reviews and every  reviewer   says he will be nominated 
for his first Oscar! not only is the physical transformation startling  but 
so is intense performance ! +Jason Kowing +Sabrina Benton Ôªø
I really want to see this.Ôªø
Oh!  Almost forgot one.  I didn't realize that was Matthew frigging 
McConaughey until halfway through.  The trailer is kind of all over the 
place, but it still looks mighty intriguing.Ôªø
Saw this a few hours ago. Great performances by Matthew McConaughey and 
Jared Leto. Ôªø
cant wait to wtach this move in cinema!!Special for JL:DÔªø
I swear Rayon is the crush of my whole youth. Ôªø
Check out this video on YouTube:Ôªø
Great film. McConaughey is such a great actor. Jared was fantastic also. It 
was so well done, but then again we have to remember that  this was an 
actual experience of someone's life. Yeah, one of my favorite films. Ôªø
I aint watching this gay ass movie.

Looks soft as fuckÔªø
Potential Oscar entrantÔªø
GREAT!Ôªø
Seems like the 80‚Äôs were just a few years back.  Aids was a huge concern 
for everyone.  Looking forward to Jared Leto‚Äôs performance.  He‚Äôs so uber 
talented.Ôªø
Does someone know the very first track ? Ôªø
Best leading male role in a long, long time. Oscar stuff all the wayÔªø
Look's like a awesome freaking movie. Never really been a fan of 
McConaughey but this looks really interesting. Anyone know the name of the 
song that starts around 1:34? Been trying to find it but cant seem to track 
it down.Ôªø
This looks pretty enlightening.Ôªø
What is the name of the song at the end of this trailerÔªø
looking forward to...Dallas Buyers Club - Official TrailerÔªø
Don‚Äôt miss the trailer for Dallas Buyers Club directed by ID‚Äôs Jean-Marc 
Vall√©e.Ôªø
Looks good. Ôªø
I am so appreciative that Jared Leto chose to be apart of the telling of 
such an important message/story. #equality #transgender #girlslikeus 
#humanrights #transÔªø
Saw this movie tonight ..absolutely brilliant.Ôªø
There's great advance word for this film after its recent screening at the 
Toronto Film Festival.

Great performance by Mathew McConaughey inspiring, the funny thing living

Cure for anything.Ôªø

Saw the movie....

I don't care if you're not into Jazz, but considering the story's set in 
the 1920s I was disappointed to barely hear Jazz and hear poorly placed rap 
music. I know you need to connect to kids, but for godsakes, the soundtrack 
made the whole experience irritating.Ôªø
the gatsby is a human representation of failed hope. but also the symbol of 
confidence.Ôªø
can someone tell me name of songs used in trailer please? thank youÔªø
Reading the book now in school, and then I'll finally watch the movie :DÔªø
EVEN THE FREAKING TRAILERS ARE AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO 
MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
whats the last song called anyone?Ôªø
In this movie, we know exactly who is bad and good people. So if you don't 
know something for real/ true, don't ever dare to judge.
This movie teaches us to think more!! <3 LDÔªø
James Gatz played with fire and he got burnedÔªø
What's the last song played towards the end?Ôªø
whats the first song called anyone? Ôªø
this is niceÔªø
1:06 MAH BOI thats the king from ytpsÔªø
"Cant repeat the past? Why oh course you can!" Best line in history.Ôªø
why is this movie trailer so bombÔªø
Such a good movie.Ôªø
RubbishÔªø
Strong movie!Ôªø
Best movie ever! :) Ôªø
Great movie. Really enjoyed it.Ôªø
Best movie. Its on my top three movies of my lifeÔªø
Sadly the trailer was better than the movie Ôªø
 I just cant distinct ly hear it .ya know some kind of hearing problemÔªø
It's Florence & the machine- over the love, not bedroom whatever.Ôªø
I've read the book many times (It's one of my favorites), but I've been 
putting off seeing the movie for fear that it's going to be a complete 
joke. I have to ask, is the movie any good?Ôªø
great trailer. boring film.Ôªø
$$$$
gravity. a nice movie, especially the effects! players might have been 
different!Ôªø
Terrible graphics because she looks animated which she is but you shouldn't 
be able to notice anyway.Ôªø
All those saying that the movie is boring seriously need to f- off. I know 
that clooney had to do that 'I'm-the-cool-guy' acting but I really 
appreciate sandra's. Yes it was the same acting,  what more do you expect? 
On the whole the movie had a good storyline , good graphics and it was not 
boring at all. Probably if you're a sci fi fan you'd enjoy it moreÔªø
Just saying... but this film is kind of boring, the only best parts are 
when the ship crashes :/...Ôªø
This could have been a good movie if Clooney and, mostly, Sandra Bullock 
were not in it. Sandra Bullock sucks as an actor (same shitty acting). Same 
with Clooney; you see the same pretending 'cool' acting. Nothing different. 
These actors are outdated. Nothing real about these two.Ôªø
The movie broke Newton's 2nd law when Clooney tells Bullock to let go. It 
wasn't required, he was already at rest.Ôªø
Without it, the movie +Gravity would just be called "Sandra Bullock and 
George Clooney go to space, come back again and nothing much happened in 
between.‚Äù What are we talking about ‚Äì and *what does it have to do with the 
European Parliament?* Find out @ epgplus.eu/pT.Ôªø
Very beautiful in the cinema and great reality of space! Luck? Maybe. 
Acting? Superb! 8.2/10
#movie   #trailer   #space   #oddysey   #shrapnel  Ôªø
I just don't get something. Why did Clooney have to die? A tug in the 
tether would have brought them together. She could have just bend and try 
and grab the strings on the parachute and tug him back. He could have left 
the jetpack and push it on the opposite direction with his feet (it's 
conservation of the linear momentum. They even used that when she threw the 
fire extinguisher in order to squeeze that bit of momentum). Also why 
didn't she use the RCS system of the soyuz (the thing she used to stop 
rotating) in order to get some momentum towards the chinese station ? It's 
a fun movie but these things boggle me...Ôªø
The visuals and sound are stunning and deserved their Oscars they won. 
However, I do feel that this movie was just overall above average but not 
phenomenal. This is probably one of, if not, the best experience(s) in IMAX 
3D. Ôªø
Alfonso Cuar√≥n had to have spent a significant amount of time playing
 Final Fantasy VIII.Ôªø
Thought Clooney was horrible in this movie.

His acting was so acting-schoolishÔªø
I CRIED WHEN SHE FINALLY FELT LAND AGAIN, AND HAD TO GET USED TO WALKING IN 
GRAVITY AGAIN. THE MOVIE ENDED TO QUICKLY, I WANTED HER TO HAVE A HERO'S 
WELCOME FROM NASA AND THE COUNTRY. THIS MOVIE IS WHAT TOM HANKS TRIED AND 
FAILED TO DO YRS AGO WITH CASTAWAY.Ôªø
I watched the opening scene of this movie during a particularly rough 
takeoff. Hands down the most stressed out I had been in a while. Ôªø
This movie is sooooo overrated, I don't understand the hype. Yes, the use 
of silence and the overall cinematography was pretty good, but it does not 
make up for the boring plot and boring ending. I feel like this movie just 
lacked any substance.Ôªø
10 mins into the movie. A girl in space is trying to escape highly 
unrealistic cloud of debris that knows nothing about laws of physics. Ok, 
interesting start.
30 mins into the movie. Hmm, the same girl is still trying to escape the 
same unrealistic cloud of debris.
1 hour into the movie. You'll never guess, the girl is still escaping the 
aforementioned cloud of debris.
40 sec before credits. The girl has finally escaped the unrealistic cloud 
of debris.

Great movie !Ôªø
from here is see this movie is FULL retardedÔªø
one of the most best sci-fi movies i have ever seen......with an 
exceptional cinematography and use of 3D.. 
i think he meant the other guy was a dumbass
The scenario in 3 words: TITANIC meets SOLARIS
what does imjenn mean?
It was literally amazing
I didn¬¥t at all nor i heard from anyone else that watched it, both are 
great movies though.
if you dont like this movie..you just dont like special effects and 
suspention....amazing movie
$$$$
that much swearing with a kid..oh great..hand the parents money and let him 
be in a movie where he sees tittes and swears as much as he likes..great 
parents...Ôªø
2:00 hahahahahahahahaha !Ôªø
Awesome movie. Highly recommend. Ôªø
Has Jason Bateman= Watching! Ôªø
I don't care if this movie is clich√© or predictable xD But it's soo funny , 
different kind of comedy haha! Still laughing :PÔªø
Going to see this movieÔªø
Just watched the movie. Was worth the time :) 
Funny and nice actors. 7/10. Maybe 6/10 because it was super easy to 
predict.Ôªø
Just watched this movie and it was hilarious in its own right, the movie 
has a very serious undertone and direction.. We don't know going into the 
movie what his clear motives are, but there is an outcome that he is 
looking for by entering the spelling bee. No spoiler alerts here.

Also I don't think anyone could of pulled this off but Bateman, even 
mulling over in my brain, Billy Bob and Downey Jr. wouldn't have been able 
to do it.. They are to old for the plot that unfolds in the end of the 
movie..

Enjoy everybody!!!Ôªø
goin to see this tonight.. looks freakin hilariousÔªø
MUST see this.. hahaÔªø
Why is there a commercial before a movie commercial?...that's just 
shamelessÔªø
Looks horrible.Ôªø
Oooooh! This looks wonderful.Ôªø
'Slumdog', 'Curry Hole', 'Your Bags Ticking'? Mate, that's racist. Imagine 
if the pun was about a black guy and Jason said 'Watermelon hole' 'Kunta 
Kinte' and 'Ill tell them you've got crack in your bag'. No way would you 
be able to say that, thats super racist, but why is it different if the kid 
is indian? If thats what Bateman thinks is funny then I don't think I want 
to watch this film.Ôªø
This and 22 Jump Street are probably going to be the funniest movies of the 
year. Jason Bateman is a good actor, so I'm sure he'll do a good job in 
that movie. I can picture Billy Bob Thornton playing as that type of 
character, but Bateman seems to fit pretty well in that role. Ôªø
the child is from the movie Lone Survivor It is super funnyÔªø
Hahaha. Might need to see this. Ôªø
whats the song called in the backround?Ôªø
Is that aziz in mini version? Ôªø
dude i am so happy, ive been looking for a comedy to watch for an hour and 
this is absolutely perfect... thank you jason bateman for making this world 
a better placeÔªø
Lol that kid.. I need to see thisÔªø
Blasphemy!Ôªø
The movie was hilarious. Loved every second of itÔªø
I thought it was pretty funny. Most comedies out today are what I would 
consider the epitome of floccinaucinihilipilification.Ôªø
Good movie. go see it guys..broaden your perspective on ageÔªø
$$$$
who cares...
this movie just amazing!Ôªø
It is painful how much I hate this movie. Sorry I sound like a hater. But 
it is a stupid, poorly made American copy of Starbuck. A beautiful French 
made film. I mean almost word for freckin' word! Not right. Starbuck is 
streamed on Netflix so watch it! It is sensitive, funny and clever and 
Patrick Huard as the lead is perfect!Ôªø
Starbuck remake :(Ôªø
Vince should do drama,cos he aint funny one bit..Ôªø
And this is a remake of a canadian 2011 movie.... i think it's too soon.Ôªø
im inLove with this Movie now , will you marry .... LolsÔªø
Hes got moobsÔªø
When will hollywood stop punking us & stop putting this guy in films, he's 
such a grinch  Ôªø
my mind is completely blown.Ôªø
Waiting for that DVD to come out.Ôªø
Otto , Yts . Yify or whatever. Ôªø
good story, but Vince should follow Adam Sandler out the Hollywood door. 
They aint funny no more.
  Ôªø
I love this movie really :) - i give it 10/10Ôªø
american ripoff of starbuckÔªø
Vince Vaughn you just earned my respect. Finally you are doing some real 
acting. Ôªø
ah I hate these movies that come out in jul or so and it is 2014 still no 
hd .. Ôªø
For some reason, I always enjoy movies with Vince Vaughn in it :DÔªø
AMAZING woowÔªø
why is there so much crappy movies recently like this, im not even going to 
pirate this because seems so horribleÔªø
I liked the French version so much!Ôªø
Starbuck is a Quebec movie which is in french. I live in quebec but ask 
yourself what english person wants to watch a french movie with english 
subtitles. The movie was so good they decided to remake it so the mass of 
the world could enjoy it. Its not a rip off. the story is good but just 
makes more money in english. simpleÔªø
It was a bery very good movieÔªø
what's the song played on the background? pls?? Ôªø
He fucked a lot of womansÔªø
I just finished watching it its an awsome movie I give it a 10 out of 10 a 
must watch and one of my new favorites.Ôªø
$$$$
In three words I would say this is funny, weird,and sometimes disturbing I 
like it awesome üòõÔªø
Haha so funny
good god it never turned blue on meh ;D
haha 
Luv it and
love this fucken movie

I LOVE THIS FUCKING MOVIE :) #^#
Julia I'm subscribe to you ?
Love this movie!!
Great Trailer.
Im gonn watch two today in cinema
None
$$$$
I just didn't like the writing and direction of the film... I thought it 
had potential but overall couldn't fill its own ambition. Ôªø
you know what is weird, critics threw up on this movie, but when i look 
down in the comments people love this movie, seems like some people need to 
get firedÔªø
I just saw this movie and I loved it! Its not constantly funny or is it 
constantly serious. Its a good mix between. The villain is easy to hate, 
Tonto is easy to love, and the Lone Ranger is moderately sexy. I dont get 
why people wont watch the movie, its is quite good. Is it "best movie 
ever", no its not. Its one of those movie you watch with friends,its easy 
to get excited while watching it. I'd recommend it to people. 
Edit: I will gladly answer questions if you are skeptical about watching 
it. Just expect a spoiler if you do ask a question.Ôªø
I would give this movie a C+Ôªø
It's probably easy to enjoy it if you're not a native American who is being 
caricatured. Can you imagine if Johnny Depp was wearing face paint and 
pretending to be an African American for a film? I think people would be 
outraged, and that's before you think about the dumb stereotypes being 
pushed. 
Why does America insist on shitting on its natives again and again? Shame 
on Depp too.Ôªø
Tanto=funny as hell 
*lone ranger shoots two bad men and kills then with one shot* Tanto: GREAT 
SHOT!!
Lone Ranger: That was ment to be a warning shot!!
Tanto: In that case.....not so great.

ROTFLOL!!!Ôªø
In my opinion I don't get why people consider it great but I also don't get 
why others consider it terrible.

I just found it to be a bad film. Armie Hammer and Johnny Depp did good, 
the action's not bad, the effects are well done and the music is great but 
my main problem with the film is that the script is just stupid and drags 
the film longer than it needed to be... and it was two and a half hours!.

It's not one of the worst movies ever, it's just incredibly bloated. A lot 
of stupid films can be fun to watch but sadly not this one I'm afraid.

*Two out of Five* is what I'll give it.Ôªø
Not many films made like this nowadays. It was a damn good movie and funny.Ôªø
if you like Johnny Dep, movie is  9.5/10...Ôªø
I LOVE this film! I hope Disney gives it another shot...Ôªø
Sorry this was my ultimate guilty pleasure movie, loved it.Ôªø
This film was epic.Ôªø
Fun movie.  Bloated, yeah.  But lighten up.Ôªø
I enjoyed this movie and Johnny Depp was realy funny a must watch 
beautifullÔªø
really liked this movieÔªø
Sorry bit loved the movie..the horse was a great add...not a serious movie 
so come on people find some humor!Ôªø
Wow really sorry why do a legend like that?Ôªø
This movie is goodÔªø
I love all Johnny Depp movies is he only dated black women he will always 
be my favorite actorÔªø
HI-YO BULLSHIT!!!!Ôªø
Don't you hate it how the trailler makes the movie seem so epic, but for 
real the movie is totally not like the movie?Ôªø
Can anyone tell me why the Pirates of the Caribbean skull is there??? 1:23and does this movie have something to do with the pirates movies???Ôªø
I actually thought this was quite a good film, really not sure why it 
flopped!Ôªø
Everyone says this movie is crap but damn this looks awesome :D I'm gonna 
watch itÔªø
Johnny is great!Ôªø
$$$$
Too much humor it ruined the movie.Ôªø
Awesome movie! Like Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow, awesome 
SCI-Fi movieÔªø
pumpkinsoul12, this is a test of all of us. and this is not HELL!. Ôªø
What¬¥s wrong with this movie again?
It¬¥s a good SCI-FI movie.What did you morons expect?
A world end with a swiss watch precision?
Relax, it¬¥s just a fucking movie.Ôªø
Such a shitty movie.Ôªø
We are all dead, this is hell I'm sure of itÔªø
Some1 know where i can find this movie online?Ôªø
well, 2012 been and gone. i bet the film makers felt pretty dead.Ôªø
2014 Like a bossÔªø
2014 bitches
Ôªø
2014 and im still watching this movie. I remember back in 2010 I never 
wanted to watch the movie, because I was too scared.Ôªø
Fuck Religions Ôªø
 When I have kids, I'm going to show them this movie and tell them I 
survived this.Ôªø
2:03 North Korea likes videoÔªø
wow!! this made me think that the world will actually end in 2012 but goess 
what it didnt Ôªø
Well, it must of been very frightening for us all to watch this movie 
before 2012, but after 2012 we watch it like a BOSS. Why did they have to 
make it Soo obvious by releasing a movie about an expected real end of the 
world, thts soo retardedÔªø
fake lol the world hasnt ended its been 2 yearsÔªø
best movie ever!Ôªø
Come on, guys. That was 2 years ago. The Mayan indianas didn't figure it 
out right.Ôªø
one day im going to tell my children that i've survive this haha ..Ôªø
I liked the day after tommorow more but this movie was pretty awesome too!Ôªø
Seriously? Watch you tung... 
You should turn your face and be quit <>_<>Ôªø
But it didn't happen! :DÔªø
maybe 2012 is still buffering.Ôªø
no one could ever predict that the world would end and seriously human is 
living for so long and the world would never unless the god make so don't 
believe in this stuffsÔªø
$$$$
This movie was AWFUL!
It was very tedious and I found it a painful chore to watch - completely 
uninspired drivel. Its just the same formula as a million other dull, 
predicable and ultimately forgettable 'comedies' based on the standard 
American comedy template. It may appeal to the easily entertained but true 
movie buffs should avoid this like the plague! (Yes, I really found it that 
bad).Ôªø
i'm gonna watch this because of Dylan O'Brian, but the movie sounds greatÔªø
Watched The Internship (aka The Google movie) this evening. It was quite 
enjoyable for $5 On Demand.

What did you think of it? Ôªø
YIFI here i come...Ôªø
All you fellow Googlers should definitely watch this film.
It's funny and also uplifting. Plus you gets to see some cool places inside 
Google HQ.Ôªø
*Attention Nooglers!*! It would be fair to say I'm sick of the sight of 
Google these days with a number of SEO projects to manage, but if you 
haven't seen The Internship, it's well with checking out. It may be 
slightly Google intensive, but it's great for taking a step away from work 
for a couple of hours. #nooglers #feelgood #internshipÔªø
Google looks like the most retarded place in the world... Noogle hats, 
retarded games, wtf??Ôªø
Screw this Im going to apply on the line for a google jobÔªø
Meant to improve Google reputation after NSA back door outrage? It wont 
cause it's cheesyÔªø
Here‚Äôs why Google is so successful: It's figured out a way for Twentieth 
Century Fox to make a two-hour Google commercial disguised as a summer 
comedyÔªø
Watch The Internship online for free, no joke! 
http://megashare.info/full_watch.php?id=TmpnNU9RPT0Ôªø
this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, Owen Wilson is 
excruciating to watch (how in the HELL does he keep getting work?) IF this 
passes for entertainment nowadays be very afraid. Ôªø
Two words...Xavier sceneÔªø
Dylan O'Brien is awesome :D

btw, whats the song starting at 1:24? someone pls answer me , i really need 
to know :pÔªø
Dylan O'Brien :D <3Ôªø
The only reason i will see this movie is DYLAN O BRIEN of course<3<3<3Ôªø
Thinkers nd Dreamers can change the world better than hopless talkers. .

Watch Michael Fassbender in the exclusive new trailer for The Counselor. 
Also starring Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Penelope Cruz and Cameron Diaz. 
Directed by Ridley Scott and written by Cormac McCarthy.

Have you been Bad?

#counselormovie #haveyoubeenbad #penelopecruz #camerondiaz #bradpitt  Ôªø
DAMN! Bradd Pitt is in every fuckin movieÔªø
Over at +The Wall Street Journal Alexandra Alter takes a look at the 
author‚Äôs involvement in the production of The Counselor, as well as its 
reception by several #film industry insiders and devout Cormac McCarthy 
fans. (‚ÄúMcCarthy writing a sex scene is maybe not a great idea,‚Äù one of 
them says.)

http://www.themillions.com/2013/10/producing-the-counselor.htmlÔªø
I don't know why but it looks like shit.Ôªø
This is why I torrent movies so I don't waste money on a possibly bad 
movie,or something that wasn't worth the money. If I liked the movie, I go 
out and pay to watch it again. Ôªø
It is Riddley Scott's movie.Ôªø
This trailer tells me nothing about what this is about... And I love that.Ôªø
"Life is being in bed with you. Everything else is just waiting."

#TheCounselorÔªø
the movie is goodÔªø
This movie was kind of awful in my opinion. Just another movie about drugs, 
control and bad guys going after bad guys. Not too intellectual, nor 
graphical, nor meaningful. Kind of disappointed. Penelope Cruz was given 
the role of the silly, unknowingly woman, and Cameron Diaz was the badass 
boss that killed everybody...really? Wouldn't recommend it.Ôªø
movie sucked!!Ôªø
I am so back and forth on this movie. A part of me loves it, and the other 
part hates itÔªø
They treat the audience as if we have all read the manual prior to 
watching. Overly indulgent facile narrative and a story that creeps along 
like a bored housewife, I gave up after 45 mins after I saw the run time. 
Crap in other words, pay cheque for the actors who looked as bored as I 
was.Ôªø
Half of the movie i have no idea what the shit they are talking about..Very 
weird movieÔªø
Big names but shit movie...Ôªø
What a piece of s**! what to expect from ridley scott and cameron diaz and 
brad pitt.
Whatch mexican movies and learn from the real thing.Ôªø
An Ace movie with Ace actors and cars holy shitballzzzzz!Ôªø
Rent movies from Red Box, The most U loose is a Buck plus tax.........Ôªø
My advise to anyone who has not yet watched it. DONT WATCH IT! This is one 
sick more terrifying movie than even a horror movie with the scariest 
motherfuken ghouls and zombies eva. How the fuck can i get those images 
outa my head! FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!Ôªø
this is sooooooo stupid movie .. the end is more stupid.. Ôªø
Warning SPOILER. Do not read further if you don't want to know the ending. 
I can't believe how this movie ends. All the actors you root for get killed 
horribly or end in misery. Play writing 101: the story needs to be 
inspiring. Hero must overcome the challenges. Movies are not about real 
life, it's about having a great evening. Also the sex scenes I liked but 
it's almost a porn. Would not want my parents sitting next to me there! The 
killing scenes however were traumatising. People their heads get chopped 
off slowly and in all detail. What the fuck! I'll be more careful next time 
to watch a movie. Ôªø
Piece of fukin garbage, what a waste of actors. god....so badÔªø
This movie is not for people who lives in a ''fantasy'' world. This movie 
is about real life, you will learn that in this life bad things will 
happend no matter who you are, and for some of us, maybe we are not to have 
a ''happy ending''.Ôªø
and downloading =)Ôªø
sucked.  Diaz looks like an old hag anymore.Ôªø
$$$$
I like the part when Emma say "I'm not fucking around" it was completely 
unexpected, I never thought she'd say anything like that. Ôªø
They all die. Now do yourself a favour and don't watch it. It's 
shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

Please be This is the end 2!!!!Ôªø
This has to be the worst movie I have watched this year, it is just 
terrible. In fact I could not bring my self to see it to the end... too 
painful!Ôªø
I swear, this movie is just as bad as The World's End. Project X, Movie 43, 
The Bourne Legacy, That's My Boy, White House Down and horror movies! They 
all suck! Final Fantasy XII: Advent Children, Bionicle movies, Naruto 
movies, Bleach movies and Evangelion movies all the way! Ôªø
OMG this movie sucks, i didn't even get to the half of it. How it's a 
comedy movie and has tragic in it. I swear no other comedy movie will ever 
top Project X PERIOD!!!!Ôªø
Too much mess,too much stupidity, not at all funny. watch scary movie 
insteadÔªø
HERMIONE!!!Ôªø
Whats with these retarded movies everyone seems to go to?!!? is everyone 
retarded?!!?!? I'm so sick of these college themed idiotic movies, someone 
needs a reality check...Ôªø
I liked superbad and loved pineapple express would i like this movie? lol 
I mean those movies were retarded but they were funny in a stupid way.
But not pathetically retarded like the scary movie series...Ôªø
Looks awesome! better go watch it. Ôªø
I can't believe some people don't like this movie.. I mean I get that 
everyone has a diff sense of humor but come on, this movie was fucking 
hilarious. It's rare that a movie has me laughing throughout the entire 
thing. Def worth the watch. Ôªø
1:54  emma watson?Ôªø
"The Lakers could've just won"

15. LA Lakers 20 39 .339 Ôªø
The Nutella. That's all you need.Ôªø
I don't know what is wrong in Spain with these movies. All of them were 
retitled with stupid names, making them seems like a bad teen (un)funny 
movie.
This was retitled as: "Party to the end" (in Spanish, of course).
Superbad was retitled as: "Superhorny/randy"
Pineapple Express was retitled as: "Superstoned"Ôªø
Is Rihanna in it?Ôªø
how is this movie bad. you all must be mentally challengedÔªø
0:29 loool
it was a joy to watch! haha!
THIS MOVIE IS FUKIN AWSJOME!!
*patrick stewart impression* you thought that was real? ACTING!!
This movie is so fucking funny, the ending killed me! So great!
What a waste of time this is...
Only the dopest movie Iv ever seen since Furious 6!!
$$$$
P.s. Mark Ruffalo is about 8 billion times better at acting than 
Gyllenhaal. *A man who would have made a better cop than the greasy haired, 
blinking, cupboard.Ôªø
Possible spoiler......... Just saw the movie and it was one of the best on 
the edge of ur seat I've seen in a long time. But I gotta say the father of 
the girl named Anna was just as bad as the abductor of the kids. Cruel 
bastard.Ôªø
A very good movie.Ôªø
Hey anyone whos watched this movie, is it good? I might watch itÔªø
**Spoiler alert**


We were supposed to feel bad about what happened to Alex but didn't he 
abduct the girls in the first place? He was the one who took them in the 
camper and the old lady decided to keep them. So in the end, the father was 
right to torture the guy wasn't he? All that time he knew where they were! 
So why wasn't Alex charged with kidnapping? Ôªø
I was upset when Hugh Jackman didn't even get nominated for an oscar for 
his acting in this movie... Come on! His best yet.Ôªø
Hugh Jackman deserved an oscar nomination for this. His best performance 
thus far.Ôªø
Honestly the trailer doesn't do this movie justice. I am so surprised that 
this didnt get nominated everyone did an amazing job. IT was so raw and 
realistic. Ôªø
When I rented this I didn't think too much of it but when I watched it I 
felt every bit of what was happening. Great acting, especially by Hugh 
jackman. Not too many movies can actually make me feel for the characters 
like this didÔªø
I have not yet seen the movie but IMO i think detective loki is behind it. 
the vibe he gives off in the trailer spells bad news. Can't wait to find 
out! :DÔªø
I really don't understand the why people love this movie. It wasn't that 
good. And how the hell is it on The IMDB top 250??? No idea... Ôªø
This movie was great.  Some cliche stuff but it still managed to be 
suspenseful.Ôªø
 Jake Gyllenhaal <3Ôªø
great moviesÔªø
How far would you go to rescue your child? To get informations? Great 
movie. A lot to think about after watching this one. 7.5/10
#movie   #trailer   #thriller   #abduction   #torture  Ôªø
whoever needs this movie needs an awardÔªø
I just rented this moive and it's REALLY a good movie, a lot of suspense 
and twist.  I literally HATE the ending but I won't give away what happens. 
Only thing this movie needs is an alternate ending option.   This movie is 
two thumbs up. A movie that will keep you on edge.Ôªø
Hugh Jackman in this movie reminds me how joel from The Last Of Us on the 
looks! omg!Ôªø
Best movie I've seen lately! 
I'll admit there were a few plot holes but it did make sense.Suspend your 
disbelief more
I was amazed this film a lot, Friend, take time this at: watchthismovie.us
It's a really great movie but can somebody please explain to me what the 
guy who committed suicide had to do with anything? I drew links between all 
the events except his role in the movie.
This movie is amazing!
STOP BITCHING about THE ENDING. USE YOUR FUCKING BRAIN! GREAT MOVIE AND 
GREAT ACTING BY HUGH AND JAKE!
On a scale of a disney movie to The Last House on the Left, how gory is 
this movie?
$$$$
Nice :DÔªø
he went from Scarlett to an old bag D: lolÔªø
The biggest crap all time.Ôªø
amaze this movie remind so much someone that i know...  Ôªø
Almost every guy that knows how to use a computer between the ages of 18-30 
can relate to this movie. I found out that I seen most of the porno clips 
in this movie lmao. Ôªø
This movie was so damn good and realisticÔªø
after watching this movie, I felt sexuality attracted to Julianne Moore Ôªø
This movie is amazing just amazing, Goto go and watch my porn lolÔªø
I saw this trailer while trying to watch porn.Ôªø
Well he was right about them giving awards for porn at least. They should 
too. After all, porn stars work way harder (or are worked way harder) than 
some of the actorsÔªø
Loved it. Simple, to the point, good topic, good acting, a big exaggerated, 
but it was there to prove a point. Good effort. 8 from me.Ôªø
Message of this story (in a nut shell), Men - Woman are more then just a 
"play thing"! Woman - Men are more then just your "slave"!Ôªø
I'm gonna live this lifeÔªø
"They give awards for porn, too."Ôªø
Anyone know the name of the song in the beginning of this trailer??Ôªø
loved this movie .. funny  in my opinion ...  Ôªø
Funny how i've watched every porn video that was in this movieÔªø
Great movie! Gordon-Levitt did a great job portraying a Jersey shallow not 
so bright douchebag!! He was very believable! Johansson  and Moore were 
also great with their barbie doll and disturbed wise older woman roles 
(respectively) I started liking it more towards the end (which I will not 
disclose for those who have not watched it) By the way, I also found the 
movie hilarious!Ôªø
Decent performances, but hated the movie. It was kind of boring overall.Ôªø
This movie has great soundtracks and musical scores.Ôªø
/r/PornFreeÔªø
I loved this movie. Great acting, simple and clean storyline and the issue 
at hand couldn't be more relevant. Ôªø
Conclude the trailer with Mark Wahlberg... definitely need to see the movie 
now.Ôªø
I knew Joseph was badass...can't wait for him to create more work! Ôªø
@kasuki1000 you do know that Mark Wahlberg is Marky Mark right?
$$$$
Tyson and Holyfield in the end xaxax lol :)Ôªø
i understand ROCKY ! but De Niro ? he good only to watch rocky fight :DÔªø
lol what was jesus llike? was he cool? great comebackÔªø
Haha kevin heart is awesome!Ôªø
Stallone needs counselling to stop making any more boxing movies and 
realise that it's not good to hit peopleÔªø
OMFG! Good Thing the referee aint a Rap Artist or the Movie would be a FailÔªø
Yes Stallone!!!Ôªø
Shane before he joined the police force Ôªø
Oh my god... I cant remember the guys name but he is funny... the one who 
asked if Jesus was cool! OH MY GODÔªø
I can't take these critics posting here any more serious than the 
"ASSHOLES" on TV that are critics. I'd bet my right arm that 99% of them 
like "RAP" and they probably refer to it as "MUSIC." I mean how dumbed down 
can you get, eh? Oh, and part of their problem may be because they munch on 
too many "Doritos." Haha!Ôªø
Stallone: Hey (insert name of agent here) what ca' I do for yuz?
Agent: Sly, baby! I got a call for you from WB.
Stallone: Yeah? Wha' they want?
Agent: Well, Sly, I hate to tell you this but the big wigs of Tinsel Town 
have got together and the Rocky films...well, they're set to be a 
ground-breaking success.
Stallone: Wha you mean!? How can dey be? Didna dey see der las one?
Agent: That's what I said but apparently even though Balboa was clearly 
purely for financial gain in an attempt to squeeze a few more drops of 
blood from a stone, the amount of hits on YouTube of that speech to the guy 
who played your son has meant that some people actually consider it 
watchable.
Stallone: Damn! Wha were dose writers finking?
Agent: No idea. Clearly something must be done to salvage your reputation 
as a sell-out actor who will work for the biggest paycheck.
Stallone: Dam right. I can't get work if people fink I just care about der 
film!
Agent: Well, if you do want to show the world that you are the biggest 
sell-out out there, I suggest you listen to WB's idea about a new boxing 
film...

HENCE THE TRAILER YOU HAVE JUST WATCHEDÔªø
This is basically Rocky 7!Ôªø
Getting ready to watch it now.. Love em bothÔªø
S***** ass computer graphicsÔªø
Good movieÔªø
cornÔªø
The trailer gives you the whole movie. Even all the jokes.  You'd be an 
idiot to pay money for this.Ôªø
R or PG-13 ? Don now :PÔªø
Pacman and MoneyÔªø
SHANE!!! I miss u...Ôªø
Liked the movie but love the intro song to this trailer more. Anyone know 
the name of the song or who plays it???Ôªø
With a cast like this i expected a lot more but this was one of the 
corniest movies i've seen in a long time.Ôªø
Shane is alive ?WTF?Ôªø
"Except for the white guy's voice" ...

I fucking RAGE when cunts think it's ok to say things like that, but if a 
white fella was to say "except for the black guy's voice" there would be an 
outcry!!Ôªø
Ok I bought this movie today and must say it was great.  A lot better than 
I thought.  Just the right amount of Humor and Heart.Ôªø
$$$$
About to watch the Ron Howard movie #rush. Cannot wait! Going to be a 
classic. Ôªø
This film is a masterpiece.Ôªø
MUST SEE!!!Ôªø
WOW THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME! EXCELLENT ACTING BY CHRIS AND DANIEL.Ôªø
Winner Best Picture of 2013. Oh not by the Oscar's because they don't know 
shit. This movie is the Best Picture of 2013 make no mistake.Ôªø
 #RUSH is soooooo good! I've never found Chris Hemsworth attractive, but 
he's gorgeous and sexy in this movie and he delivered a great performance 
as James Hunt. Daniel Bruhl should get an Academy Award nomination for his 
portrayal of Niki Lauda.

NOTE: I changed 'Ethan' to 'James.'Ôªø
what is thor doing in a car.. he has super powers!Ôªø
This is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen, i recommend not to watch 
the trailer, it will spoil a lot.Ôªø
RUSH movie trailerÔªø
one of the best movies i have ever seen, i admired nikki lauda 
determination he's a freakin legend .Ôªø
This movie deserves the oscar..........Brilliant movie!!!!!Ôªø
Really amazing film... the actors also really amazing.. daniel br√ºhl really 
imressing so much.. and of course unforgetable... first film that make my 
brain can't stop thingking about it.. I can't slept earlier because too 
excited to browse their real life.. good job!! :D by the way.. I will miss 
this film and also the character of the actors... :")Ôªø
This movie is fantastic. I'm always wary about watching sports-related 
films since I don't give a shit about any of these sports. But this is 
truly a fantastic film and is about the human story behind the car racing. 
Would recommend to everyone.Ôªø
Chris Hemsworth‚ô•‚úåÔªø
Epic movie, epic music, epic story.... Ôªø
soo pissed that daniel br√ºhl didn't get the golden globeÔªø
Excellent..Ôªø
DVD release date ? does anybody know? cant wait!!!
 Ôªø
Probably the best movie of 2013!Ôªø
Don't particularly like dramas and biographies. Saw the movie. Got my ass 
kicked by it's epicness. Best movie of 2013. And this trailer is a 
masterpiece. Ôªø
A fantastic story of two opposing sides, neither one hero or villain, 
simply humanÔªø
Amazing movie.... Greatest movie I've ever seen on true Incidents.....Ôªø
i feel like I don't have to watch the movie any more. the trailer pretty 
much says it all O.oÔªø

Ôªø
I'm pretty sure somewhere in this movie, she's meant to shoot him the leg...
:D

This film really got to me. I cried several times, and when it ended, I 
threw my iPod (which I was watching it on) at the door. This is like the 
most emotional and one of the best films everÔªø
PETER AND TRIS WHAT ARE U DOING!?!Ôªø
Suddenly I see all the actors from Divergent starring in the same movies

This trailer spoiled the scary scenes :(Ôªø
OmgÔªø
So did this thing happen in the real story ?Ôªø
Very good and fun movie. Didn't like the ending -_-Ôªø
Scariest movie I've ever seen!!!Ôªø
2:40 O.M.G Ôªø
Where can i watch the full movie?Ôªø
omfg goose bumps all overÔªø
I saw the movie. It was beyond scary and amazing. The part I don't 
understand is the beginning. You could of started it with Bathseba Thayer 
cursing the acres of land. But instead the people who made the movie 
decided to put a bunch of teenagers or young males and females talking to 
somebody. The part that I find most disturbing is the hide and seek scene. 
Poor woman almost died.Ôªø

But it looks pretty good, will rent it someday.Ôªø
Super funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
Lol it's a big black penis!!!Ôªø
Lol, this movie was freaking hilarious Ôªø
One of my top three favorite comedies. I'm also in love with Get Him To The

Seem's like they can't make a movie today without a ''dick'' scene!. Funny 
movie but sometime's they go to far ..
go fuck yourself little cunt
who pays for a movie when there is a bay full of gentle pirates? :P

Nice Trailer, I was watching two times so farÔªø
All done for the day; now it's movie time :)

http://youtu.be/CI4EjV_x_PQÔªø
I just watched Escape Plan, was surprised,  Arnolds acting was great ! 
 Movie was pretty good....Ôªø
Damn, this trailer shows waaay too much. I just got a summary of the whole 
film in 2,5 minutes! I just wanted to see a sneak peak, not the whole movie 
summed up.Ôªø
had to stop in the middle of the trailer before i feel like i watched the 
movie already...Ôªø
I like how the title says "Schwarzenegger" instead of the actual main 
character of the movie, Sylvester Stallone. The better of the two 80's 
action movie stars. Ôªø
"Fitty"always has a complex that he is not smart enopugh(wonder why)so  in 
most of the movies he play the sensivitve  bitch.We all got it "Fitty":you 
are a smart and sensitive rapper(i think Mad tv also observed it :watch MAD 
TV - Sad 50 Cent)Ôªø
u gotta see nonstopÔªø
Movie was great.Ôªø
'You hit like a vegetarian' hahahahahÔªø
i dont get it...after all these years of being rivals, not liking one 
another, stallone and arnold, all of a sudden they do every single movie 
together like bff??Ôªø
looks goodÔªø
This movie was just...lol. Basicly, so this guy goes to jails and checks 
them to see if they actually work. So to do this, he kills people when they 
are JUST doing their job? I found it really hard to see who was the good 
guy here, the people doing their job and keeping prisoners in jail, or the 
prisoners breaking out?
The ending of the movie was even more halarious. He explodes the whole 
prison, killing all innocent people who where just doing their jobs to keep 
bad people in jail. So really hes just saying " Sorry mother fuckers, your 
prison didnt fit up to standards, so all of you die."Ôªø
i just watch whole movie in 2 30 min trailerÔªø
This is the best i sawÔªø
Great movie guys . must watch Ôªø
Love how arnold puts so much trust into sylvester. LolÔªø
Allahu AKBAR!! Its is Great to see a Muslim Brother as a Hero!! PEACEÔªø
very cool movieÔªø
50 cent as a brain whiz? O k, pass. Should have at least got Aldis Hodge.Ôªø
Anybody who has seen this trailer has seen the whole movie..Ôªø
Go see this movie!!!! You will NOT regret it. Don't wait for it to be On 
Demand or DVD. This is the kind of movie that must be seen in theaters. The 
same thing applies to GRAVITY!
Wft tifty cent diam
and when convicts in prisons watch this, the governments be trippin
yay for real movies!!!

Good actors wasted on a pitiful remakeÔªø
There's just something so dramatically fake about all these remakes in the 
past decade - as if they TRY too hard to trump the originals. Despite all 
the cold technology, they just seem to lack the originality, personal, and 
sereneness of the originals.    Ôªø
Spike Lee,

I just saw your crap remake. Just give it up...

You could *NEVER* make a film as tragic and original as this depraved 
classic.Ôªø
please don't remake anymore... its just degrading the original.Ôªø
i know the original movie is lot better..i just wanna know whts d name of 
Background Music? can anyone help?Ôªø
So the beginning looked a little promising, kinda keeping with the original 
and it was with an actor I like. But as soon as he got out of the suitcase 
it looks like they got the story wrong and the part where he goes through 
the hallway looks messed up. Why even remake what is already great.Ôªø
how the hell people can think that korean version was better? it was the 
most disgusting and the most ridiculous movie i have seen, it was excessive 
and unnecessary long, what the hell is wrong with people nowadays? this 
remake is much better!Ôªø
The original Korean "Oldboy" was way too good. With excellent acting. You 
cannot make or improve such a movie. Plus a lot of scenes seem to copied 
from the Original. If you haven't seen the original, watch it first, you 
can find it online. You'll see what most of the comments are trying to 
say. Ôªø
Anybody know name of that opera? song played on this moment in movie 1:55,when that guy swim in poll,please if anybody know name of that song ?In 
movie thats 67 minutes and 11 seconds ,then that song play ;)Ôªø
Why remake it ?Why?I am not raging because I like the film but because it 
DOES NOT NEED to be REMADE.Remakes are for movies that are outdated either 
ethically or technologically!But people in America do not like Asian or 
European actors so there is their excuse to remake movies.They are not 
comfortable if they do not see in the screen their beloved made-up 
Hollywood faces...Ôªø
Oldboy (2013) is a very dark, twisted and NSFW movie, but damn great! A 
most see (if you like the genre)!Ôªø
where the hell can i find this movie, i cant find it anywhereÔªø
I can't believe that so many people have seen the Korean version of this 
film and I've never heard of it until now.  I watched a few mins of the 
original on Netflix, but I had to stop because it was so boring. Ôªø
Wow this movie is fucking epic. Its a 5 star. Watch it as soon as possible!Ôªø
A bit rich saying it's "from" director Spike Lee. It's basically a copy. 
He's done nothing!Ôªø
Spike lee did a phenomenal! with the remake of this movie. I speak full 
Korean and have seen the original (Old boy) ages ago and living in S.korea 
for ten years most Koreans agree, this remake was fantastic...Ôªø
Why the fuck would they remake one of the greatest movies ever? And put it 
out with another tell the whole fuckin story trailer, you  damn holywood 
idiots!Ôªø
you know when you remake a French movie I kind of see the point asking WHY 
but in the case of an asian movie most of us wants a remake since we want 
to SEE the acting (asians have no face expression what a white person can 
actually notice,you know like Steven Segal having the same face when he is 
angry or happy) and not read the acting Ôªø
i have seen a manga with the same story, was uoloaded in 2011.Ôªø
You do realise that English is a foreign language for the vast majority of 
the globe, right? So this version does nothing for them.
WATCH IT NOW: va4movie.com
thanks, never knew India did a remake. 
Nope. Watch the original. 
I literally spat my drink out when I heard this was being remade, just no.
Love the original. Did not want to see this until I realized it was Brolin. 
Now I definitely have to see it.
$$$$
Cumberpatch is like this generations tony jay i swearÔªø
This film was so amazing, watched it in the cinema in 3D then on BluRay at 
home. The end gets me every time. I'm about to watch it again tomorrow. I 
can't wait to watch it with my GF for the first time, she is amazing when 
watching films (she's always amazing) because she can get really into a 
film and be really emotional about what's happening so I can't wait for her 
reaction to this :')

Btw. This trailer is mindblowing, gets me the watery eyesÔªø
people bitching about cumberbatch appealing to the lady fans ought to 
remember what Montalban was known for before Khan.Ôªø
I cant wait to see what Abrams does with the Borg. Ôªø
Hello Sherlock holmes.. haha ^_^ Ôªø
What is the name of the music?Ôªø
Can you imagine if Benedict Cumberbatch was Darth Vader?Ôªø
It's kind of funny how J.J.Abrams worked on star wars to, (star trek, Star 
wars). Someone has a thing for stars lol.Ôªø
The main reason why I want to watch this movie is because of Benedict 
Cumberbatch <3Ôªø
Hey, Jerk Jerk Abrahamson?  This is NOT Star Trek.  This is YOUR 
masturbatory scifi wet dream.  The title should have been:  Revered 
Franchise Chucked Into Darkness.  Trek long distinguished itself as the 
thinking person's scifi but you've managed to glom it in with all the other 
over-produced schlock in the genre.  It was a dark day for the devotees 
when your name came up at paramount.  Hopefully they will get someone who 
knows and values the material next time.  Maybe we can get back to the 
established mythos and write your crap off as a bad dream that Kirk had at 
the academy.  You failed at Trek.  God help the future of Star Wars.  BTW 
that smoke wafting up from Montalban's grave is caused by the friction of 
his corpse spinning like a top.  The crowning jewel of his career has been 
bastardized by a second string hack who couldn't act his way out of a high 
school play.  EDITORIAL NOTE ADDED AFTER THE FACT:  This post reflects the 
views of only the poster and in no way implies that they are aware of a 
multitude of Trek fans who are dissatisfied with the current direction of 
the franchise.Ôªø
I wonder how many thumbs up/commenters are cumberbitches Ôªø
people who dont like into darkness are appropriately called 'faggots'Ôªø
Benny!!! <3Ôªø
Very good movieÔªø
I absolutely love Benedict Cumberbatchs voice Ôªø
One of the best of 2013 gotta love J.J Ôªø
IT'S A TRAP.....Oh wait, wrong movie!Ôªø
They should make a new batman movie with Khan and his crew as the villains.Ôªø
I'm probably one of the few people in the world who doesn't actually likes 
Benedict Cumberbatch... I think he's just so overrated... Ôªø
I hate this kind of trailers, too much spoil for meÔªø
two words: BENEDICT CUMBERBATCH!!!!!!!!!!!! woo hooo!Ôªø
tbh I dont like such kind of movies but I gonna watch it because of 
Benedict Cumberbatch ‚ô•.Ôªø
Everyone in the world, just you wait, until Star Wars Episode 7 is 
released! Wait and see how Star Wars returns to the world, just like how 
the originals did. Star Wars needs to come back like it did when it first 
came out! Ôªø
The fundamental flaw of these movies is that they're all written and 
directed by Nerds.Abrams,Orci, Kurtzman and Lindelof-all Nerds.And since 
90% of The so called Trek Nation is made up of Nerds,that means the 
Consumer is selling to the Consumer  rather than the Merchant selling to 
the Consumer.Nerds are passionate,ferociously opinionated,tempestuous and 
when given the power to change and create a Mythos, ultimately 
egotistical.I don't know when Joss Whedon became King of The Nerds but he 
is still a NERD and therefore never admits fault like with that shitty 
Agents of Shield.He,like Orci and Abrams exploit the fact that Nerds 
worship him based on an unconscious sense of vicarious satisfaction,as if 
he were actually the Nerd representative.For these movies to be truly 
good,I think they need to abandon the whole "Nerd directing Star 
Trek=success"mentality and get a competent Director who couldn't give a 
shit about Star Trek-Why?;because then the movies can be moulded by the 
feedback and advice that the Director is given from The Trek Nation,you 
know,the heart of the Mythos.Ôªø
You can all thank Benedict Cumberbatch for turning me into a Treky.Ôªø

this is the best movie i've seen in a long time.Ôªø
Really disappointed that great actors such as these gentlemen have actually 
sold out their talent in a Movie like this. The plot was extremely 
simplistic. The idea that stereotypical hot bikini wearing women in their 
20's might even be remotely interested in men in their 70's is completely 
insane. It's insulting to men and to women as well. Do men of all ages 
'have' to lust after the stereotypical 20 something year old? Why couldn't 
we see some older sophisticated, intelligent women flirting and having a 
good time with the men, that would have been far more interesting and 
enjoyable. Make sure there are twists and men 'respecting' the younger 
women as women, not as what Hollywood would suggest all young heterosexual 
men would do. I can't truly imagine none of those men wanting to visit 
their lustful youth, but enjoy life as it is and have a fun time in Vegas, 
which means gambling, drinking, joking, talking about their lives. making 
their own fun. Where is the substance? Oh and this comes from a women who 
is 26 years younger than her man. He thought the movie was stupid so we 
left halfway.Ôªø
this movie sucksÔªø
Haha, Kevin Kline is a great actor, but damn he can be funny too!Ôªø
A great and very funny movie!Ôªø

Noticed the three leads in "think like a man" supporting in this. Talk 
about giving back to the old men.Ôªø
What a mind-numbingly boring piece of shit movie.Ôªø
AMAZING MOVIE! Where else you get to see FIVE Academy Award winners

friends at Vegas for a bachelor party/wedding etc. but NO, it's not like 
The Hangover at all! LOLZÔªø
"The Hangover: Senior Citizen Edition"Ôªø
Why is everyone suck a critic? No one gives a shit what you think honestly.Ôªø
Music in 1:00?Ôªø
There's the Hangover trilogy then Grown ups 1 and 2 and now these seasoned 
actors are having their turn of buddy comedy in Last Vegas. Should be a 
classic hit. Ôªø
looks like it could be funny. might go see it tonight :)Ôªø

I love it whenever she talks to herselfÔªø
Is this movie worth watching?Ôªø
She is absolutely incredible in this movie. Even when she's doing nothing 
she has that look of insanity in her eyes it's so amazing to witness.
Beyond oscar standard Ôªø
I just watched this and I am completely spellbound by Woody Allen's talent 
to transform emotions into art form.  As trite as the movie might have 
seemed to some, it's actually a portrait of all the emotions which overcome 
us in life; happiness, love, grief, jealousy, betrayal, inferiority, 
narcissism.  Even though Jasmine comes across as a self centred 
narcissistic  woman, to see her break down in  the end, is just 
excruciatingly painful, her power is broken into smithereens, she is just 
the shadow of the woman she once was, and that is frightening, because it 
is real life.  We come across people who talk to themselves all the time on 
the streets, people who seem lost, people staring at the sky with vacant 
eyes, and most of the time, we ignore them, but we could become one of 
them, someday.Ôªø
It's Woody Allen. You know what you are going to get. However, some of his 
movies will blow you away, this one is not one of them. The actors as an 
ensemble were great, but they weren't stretched beyond their limits. Except 
for Cate Blanchett who was spectacular. So if you are a Cate Blanchett fan, 
I highly recommend this to see her performance. I also thought Andrew Dice 
Clay was very good in this as well. Ôªø
Cate Blanchett was great in this movie and certainly Oscar worthy, but I 
see I'm not the only one who felt this was Woody Allen's version of A 
Streetcar Named Desire.  Didn't care too much for the ending though.  
Wanted a little more closure than that. Ôªø
Ma estiÔªø
LOUIE IS NOT A LOSER. FUCK YOU JASMINE!Ôªø
I just watched it. It was good - and Cate Blanchett did a great job. But I 
felt like the story was at its core A Streetcar Named Desire, with 
a slight alternate ending for all the characters.Ôªø
lets be honest, we all came here cause she won an oscar. No one gives a 
shit about this movieÔªø
Really enjoyed Blue Jasmine.  Cate was superb as the 'new money' East Coast 
socialite.  Her performance was so spot on!  I've worked with women like 
her.  Her costume of a fraying Channel suit top to her Birkin bag fit the 
character to a 'T'.  Ôªø
I saw this movie while flying from DFW to Frankfurt  back in December..I 
admit I had never had heard of it but I read the description  and it seemed 
interesting although I was skeptical it'd be boring....I knew about Cate 
Blanchett thats all...but I am really glad I randomly chose to watch this 
movie, its acted extremely well and is extremely hilarious...I had SO much 
fun watching this movie...and i'm a dude .... Great movie that not many 
knew about hopefully this Oscar will make it more famous now...Ôªø
leo DiCaprio should have his 3rd Oscar by now except he has non because the 
academy is corrupt. leo is a legendary actor how can he have no Oscar but 
the girl from the hunger games has one? she is a nobody compared to leo and 
leo was acting and doing amazing movies while Jenifer Lawrence's  mom was 
still wiping her assÔªø
Great movie, Cate portrayed the schizophrenic, socialite turned broke woman 
perfectly. Oscar deserved. And as a side note, as for Leo not winning the 
oscar, I get it, he's a great actor who has been in some great films. I 
don't know why he may not have won in the past, but despite Leo being a 
"veteran actor," the oscars give awards for the films THAT YEAR. Saying 
Jennifer Lawrence shouldn't have an oscar, as she is not as experienced an 
actor as Leo, is kinda...idk. I get not thinking she deserved an oscar, but 
being a veteran doesn't make you win the oscar. If thats the case, Meryl 
Streep would win every damn year, since she's nominated every damn year 
lol. I saw Dallas Buyers Club, and MM was GREAT in it. Leo, despite being a 
"veteran actor," lost because someone else was thought to have a better 
performance in the film that year. Despite this, as great as winning an 
oscar is, if Leo continues to make powerful movies that impact people, I 
think thats truly what winning is, as an actor.Ôªø
I haven't seen this movie but i think she deserved the best actress award!! 
:) she is an excellent actress even to the other movies!! :)Ôªø
IT HAS NO ENDING!!! ARGHHHÔªø
sounds kinda stupidÔªø
He doesn't get San Francisco and he doesn't get the working class. Bobby 
Cannavale's ridiculous haircut and Ed Hardy wardrobe was a major 
distraction for me.Ôªø
Can someone say a remake of A Street car named desire?Ôªø
A Streetcar Named Desire & Blue Jasmine. Double Indemnity & Body Heat. 
Bringing up Baby & What's up Doc?. Three great stories, six wonderful 
movies. Ôªø
my favorite woody allenÔªø
Blue Jasmine, kudos to Woody Allen, you made it again! Bu.....t, Cate 
Blanchett completely steals the show here. She is definitely a blessing to 
the film industry.Ôªø
What‚Äôs the height of hipocrisy?
A policy of not asking about sex gender in a whorehouse interview..Ôªø
tbh..family guy brought me here :$Ôªø

This movie was pretty good after all i expected more action but this is 
more of a story/emotional/intellectual movie full of plot twists and an 
impressive ending leaving you many thoughts Ôªø
I just finished watching this movie on Cinemax and it was way better than I 
expected. This is one of those movies you really have to pay attention too 
b/c you will be confused if you miss certain parts. But overall this was a 
really great movie, great acting from the actors, great storyline. I would 
definitely recommend everyone to check this movie when you get a chance. it 
really is good. and the nude scene with Rosario Dawson is a plus as well.Ôªø
crap compared to the original from 2001. Just obnoxiously loud music and 
flashy colours.

The original had intriguing mind games and fleshed-out side characters.Ôªø
 I gotta see this movie I bn hearing good things about it.Ôªø
0:58 onwards what's the song?Ôªø
this movie was amazing.Ôªø
MINDFUCK! Great movie.Ôªø
looks like a nice movie but the trailer kinda said it all :/Ôªø
This movie was so amazing like really! 
One of the best movies I ever watchedÔªø
Good movie.Ôªø
This Dawson chick completely kills this movie Ôªø
Bullshit Nolan film ripoff with "hypnotism" fuggin stupid, and I like Danny 
BoyleÔªø
Danny Boyle returns!Ôªø
Just finished watching. Better than I expected. Ôªø
*Trance* -Official Trailer
#trance   #jamesmcavoy  Ôªø
This looks... intense and interesting.Ôªø
I liked Patrick Doyle's film Trance -, a thriller that takes you to a 
different place Ôªø
Boyle's injection of energy and vibrancy means that, even if you're 
confused about elements of the plot, ''Trance'' is nonetheless captivating. 
The performances of the acting trio are excellent and Boyle's style along 
with Rick Smith's soundtrack creates a pulsating atmosphere. The flaws of 
''Trance'' prevent it from joining the pantheon of truly great Danny Boyle 
films but it's still quite a remarkable watch.Ôªø
Love it.. Ôªø
Looks like an interesting thriller from the director of Trainspotting, 
Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. Ôªø
A Danny Boyle Memento/Inception style film? YES PLEASE!Ôªø
this shits intense
Looks too cool. THERE IS A FREAKY DOOR. HELP.
stupid
One of the best movie's I've ever seen. Amazing is an understatement. 
Excellent thriller. Another bonus is the nude scene of Rosario Dawson, 
which is sublime. 
$$$$
i looooooooooooove the movie Ôªø
good movie, my only complaint is that it ended too quick, what I mean by 
that is what you've been waiting for the whole movie only last like 5 mins.Ôªø
I love Luc Besson.
This was so much better than I expected. It wasn't as comedic as the 
trailers led me to believe.Ôªø
terrible ending. 
Well, I guess it shows a message. If you're involved in this life of crime 
and mafia then you're going to have a terrible life full of enemies who 
want to murder you and you'll never be able to escape it. Ôªø
Terrible movie, i wouldnt recommend it to anyone. Not funny or entertaining 
at all.Ôªø
The shooting scene was awesome.Ôªø
I can't decide if I want to watch this. At first, the trailer made it seem 
really stupid, but then as it went on, it didn't seem so bad. I'm looking 
through the comments and it's about 60/40, leaning more towards it sucked. 
Some people say it's the worst movie ever but then some say it's the bestÔªø
One of the worst De Niro movies I've ever seen. This was a disaster. Every 
5 minutes I found a complaint with this film, the story had potential but 
the annoying characters ruined it.Ôªø
YIFYÔªø
MUSEEEÔªø
I thought this movie was okay, but it could have been a lot better because 
it had a lot of potential. I loved De Niro, Peiffer, and D'Leo's characters 
but Diana Agron's character was a little blah and but tiresome and I feel 
like she could have put a lot more effort into the part than she did. The 
character plots in themselves did not really contribute that much to the 
overall reason for the movie but they still managed to give some funny 
moments. To be honest with you I think this would have done better as an 
HBO/Cinemax/Showtime/Starz series, who knows maybe in the future.Ôªø
What's the song playing in this one called?Ôªø
omg muuuuuuuuuuseeeeeeee!!!!!!!Ôªø
What's the soundtrack playing at the start of the trailer? Someone please 
let me know..Ôªø
Great movie.Ôªø
Just saw it, I loved it Ôªø
At first, I thought it's stupid but my mom's boyfriend made me watch it and 
I like it because it's funny, little romantic, and stupid but really good 
since it's show that if you're in mob and make a mistake like that then you 
will end up have shit life with enemy groups who want to kill you and all 
you have to hide from them and trying to not expose yourself to enemy 
groups. That's my opinion :)

#infinity starsÔªø
This was the worst mafia movie ever terrible robert de niro is my favorite 
acter but this was garbage we dont even know y he snitched and his side of 
the storyÔªø
cool movie, however the amount of french who speak english fluently is 
unusualÔªø
Honestly gonna watch tis just to see Diana beat the hell outta that boy 
with a tennis racket.Ôªø
this movie is excellent!Ôªø
I think this movie is pretty stupid, the mother obviously has very limited 
knowledge of French and yet she understand enough to blow up the store and 
with it the shopkeeper and 2 customers and oh yes in a small French town 
everybody of course speaks English. Besides I do not think that the French 
government would like to have foreign criminals of that caliber living in 
France.Ôªø
One of the best movies have seen, super funny.Ôªø
The worst movie of the yearÔªø
i hope your mum gets raped
$$$$
wolverine is a lot more interesting and bad ass than any of the other x 
men. He's probably the most bad ass comic book character in general.Ôªø
Tail story for morons.Ôªø
This was pretty good. I was willing to make it a favorite of 2013 for me 
that is until I reached the ending. Jesus Christ, I hated that ending. It's 
complete bullshit and it ruined an otherwise well done flick.

If you think Days of Future Past is gonna be any better then prepare to be 
disappointed. Simon Kinberg's writing that one and judging from his resume 
it's gonna bomb pretty hard. I don't care that the Sentinels are in, I 
don't care if Peter Dinklage brings a good performance and I don't fucking 
care that Bryan Singer's back to direct!, it's still gonna suck just as 
much as X-Men 3.... which Kinberg also wrote.

FOX!. PICK A BETTER GODDAMN WRITER NEXT TIME!. GOD!.Ôªø
This trailer shows WAY too much of the movie...
But I doubt anybody reads the comments before watching the trailer :|Ôªø
I watched DVD.
Only in the early stages, it is the worst Japanese culture introduction.
When a foreigner makes a movie as a stage in Japan, the belief of the 
producer is emphasized by all means.Ôªø
Origin of wolverine was better. .the movie was good ending suckedÔªø

i was disappointed , but i do hope they make another movie better than 
this Ôªø
he is so hoootÔªø
EWWWWWWWÔªø
Soooo is he without adamantium now or idk?!?Ôªø
I only got one special question to ask jack and the people over here: 
Howcome the guy never wears the wolverine outfit in wolverine or do men 
movies??Ôªø
Saw the extended version. Solid f**king movie. Too bad DofP will overwrite 
all of what happens in it.Ôªø
I really enjoyed this movie last year ;) Bring on the sequel...Ôªø
*"The Wolverine"* stays true to the comics, the Japanese arc of the comics 
is easily "Wolverine's best story and this movie delivers more than 
justice!" Best superhero movie of the summer.
From the beginning I thought that this movie *would the worse superhero 
movie of the year*. But after exiting the cinema I was stunned, it was 
literally "a huge surprise". *Hugh Jackman kicks ass as the Wolverine like 
always and all the other actors* did a solid job. The story was awesome, it 
was nice to see the Wolverine in another way; mortal and vulnerable. There 
where awesome fight scenes and the script/conversations where decent. The 
ending was a surprise which I loved. *I loved the envirenment, Japan and 
Tokia was interesting and beautiful*, not like Origins (which was a sh*t 
movie, dont watch it). Overall, The Wolverine is one of the best action 
movies this year in my opinion

*WOLVERINE 2013* ++Ôªø
1,000,000,000 times better than Origins.Ôªø
So cccccccccoooooooooolllllllllllllllllll!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
This movie starts out staggeringly dumb. The Japanese,  world renown for 
their humane treatment of prisoners of war in 1945,  graciously empty their 
POW cages to give the guys a shot at surviving a nuclear blast. If you turn 
off your brain it's kind of mindlessly entertaining in spots.Ôªø
Hello everyone, I have just found full leaked version of this movie, so I 
think it could help you. I have just watched it and I am amazed. It might 
be the the best movie this year! Version which I found is really good 
quality (1080p as I can see). I found it here:

 I hope it will help you,  if it helped  thumb up like it so other people

Cant understand the bad reviews for this film, if you like Sci-Fi then I 
guarantee you will like this film.Ôªø
Way too many spoilers in this trailer.
Old news I guess.
Great story...Gorgeous movie!Ôªø
This is an Excellent scifi movie with a great story line.  Some of the 
effects are awesome and its full of surprise and suspense.  This movie had 
a lot of negative reviews?  I say judge for yourself, it does not get much 
better than this. Ôªø
Wow, I just saw this movie today after hearing about it and seeing a few 
glimpses mainly from posters a year ago , I was already interested in it 
then but only just now got to see it.

The amount of things that this trailer spoils is unbelievable, about 5 
different twists scattered throughout the movie are spoiled here, I'm so 
glad that I never watched the trailers before seeing the film, nor did I 
even see the films cover surprisingly because it was via cable on HBO, that 
would have spoiled the film right away too.

I was pleasantly surprised and loved how some of my guesses while watching 
the film came true, and how completely wrong I was about other things, all 
pleasantly surprised.

If I had seen just this trailer and then watched the film, I would not 
nearly have had such a good viewing experience, kind of makes you wonder if 
the film would have been more popular had the spoilers been kept out of 
trailers, but the element of the atmosphere of mystery and suspicion in the 
trailers had been kept like it was for Moon, giving away just enough to 
hook you without spoiling half the movie, subtlety, seems like its entirely 
gone from movie trailers these days.

Well in any case now I'm convinced not to even look at most trailers for 
movies I still want to see, so I can not have half the movie spoiled for 
me, as this trailer seems to do so.Ôªø
So, it is possible to create a SCi-Fi masterpiece also these days...the 
more I watch it  I like it more... now it is one of my favs...Ôªø
How old do you have to be to watch this movieÔªø
Watched Oblivion last night. I thought it was an excellent movie with a 
proper novel-esq feeling. I felt like I wanted to explore the planet with 
Tom. Proper absorbing stuff. Ôªø
Gotta love it when the trailer gives away most of the movie.Ôªø
WAT A MOVIEÔªø
What an excellent film - a must see for sci-fi enthusiasts. Amazing 
visuals, very interesting plot and smart acting. Watch this. 8.5/10 from 
me.Ôªø
like this but the trail in my opinion gives away to much.Ôªø
Awesome movie. The ONLY problem I had with it was when he plays Ramble On 
by Led Zeppelin and it shows the needle as the first song on the album when 
it's not. Other than that really good movie. Ôªø
I think the story was very good as well as the designs with the world is 
spectacular...any opinions?Ôªø
This new Google+ layout is complete bullshit....Ôªø

Best movie ever second divergent!Ôªø
 #samrockwellisagod   I have always loved Sam Rockwell ever since I saw him 
in confessions of a dangerous mind but this movie is a masterpiece  ! it 
has a very strong cast  but he steals every scene he is in!  this is a 
summer camp story and a tale where a son teaches his mother to have some 
respect for herself! odd when you see a movie where the kid is smarter than 
his mother ( Toni Collette)   Steve Carell is a great actor as always  but 
who knew he could be this unlikable?  100% range!  The screenplay was 
written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash (the Dean on Community that looks just 
like Moby)  I had parents that didnt quite get me as well ! Every one who 
was once a teenager will love this movie!  5/5 and for  +Jason Kowing its 
even completely realistic!Ôªø
Funny and heartbreaking at the same time.Ôªø
I am so gonna love this movie, oh my gahd.... i cant believe i never 
bothered to check this movie out.........Ôªø
great movie i love movies like this Ôªø
Great  movieÔªø
A 3? Despite it's just a movie script, he's a cutie!Ôªø
Why does such a good movie such a bad ending? I mean I might be wrong here 
and I didnt understand it maybe? .. But I kind of expected more.. 
DissapointedÔªø
AnnaSophia Robb's ass is amazing in this movie!!! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Ôªø
i absolutely love this movieÔªø
this is an awesome movie its a perfect mixture of happy and sad during the 
whole thing. It's the kind of movie that you think about for the next week. 
:)Ôªø
Hold, hold please, hold there :D Ôªø
I have to up in less than five hours, but it was worth staying up to watch 
the movie. If are looking for something to watch this weekend this might be 
for you.Ôªø
My favorite movie Ôªø
It was a great movie, the only thing that I would have changed is the 
ending scene, but as I said I loved the movie, it was very deep and 
emotional!Ôªø

so hard ! AWESOME MOVIE .Ôªø
I am absolutely in love with this movie. So, so great. Ôªø
Really good film

A masterpiece that distinguishes people. The moment you utter the word 
'boring' you know that you are beyond hope. Lost. Nobody can help you.Ôªø
*when I watch a movie , I want to be entertained, excited , wondering about 
someone or something in the movie and enjoying the change of events during 
that ! BUT this movie didn't give me anything,<spoilers next!>,  just a man 
on boat face a storm > the boat ruined > stayed on inflatable rubber boat > 
tow ships ignored him > face another storm > he saw another ship > burn the 
the boat so they might see him > they did > never going to sea again > The 
end ! ,, that's it, nothing especial about it , just boring , they should 
put something like a tiger or god damn mermaid for example at least to keep 
us excited !!*Ôªø
this is bullshitÔªø
Great movie for being sick at home, if I had seen this any other day it 
would have been horrible.Ôªø
The title of this movie should have been "All Is Crap"
The best part was when he knocked himself out,I should have done the same 
thing!Ôªø
Uncredited role goes to Tom Hanks. He was captain of the cargo ship.Ôªø
all he needs is a tiger on the life boatÔªø
People are saying this movie was boring. YOUR WRONG. This movie shows 
mother nature at its best. Imagine if you were alone in the ocean. Once you 
put your self in his position then the movie is no longer boring. This 
movie defines Human Nature. When (All Is Lost) What do we do. Do we hang on 
or give up ! The ending of the movie, He literally has givin up all hope 
and he goes to kill himself. As he sinks to the bottomless abyss, after 
giving up all hope. A light appears and he swims to the top & survives 
against all odds. This movie is more for people with an open mind ! This 
movie is by far one of my favorites. Human V.s Nature. In the end Nature 
will always be the dominant force !  The question is are you able to 
withstand the force ?Ôªø
Castaway seems way better than this.Ôªø
I liked that part when I briefly woke up just before I fell a sleep again.Ôªø
special effects were cool, but idk i didn't like it that muchÔªø
hope he finds wilson !Ôªø
Quite a boring movie. Maybe one good advice in the story. Stay on land.Ôªø
For anyone who will face tragedy in their life. For those that will get 
old, sick and eventually have to face death. It's so natural to freak out 
and get scared when the time comes. I'm grateful there are people who make 
movies like this to show us how to behave on those "rainy days."Ôªø
did anybody other than me notice that the soundtrack to all is lost is 
essentially the same soundtrack to mystic river's main theme???? Ôªø
LIFE OF PIÔªø
They give away so much in the trailers nowadays... 
NO.!!?
Looks amazing! 
I swear this is based on 'The old man and the sea' by Earnest Hemingway
whats the music at the end?
It takes an iconic actor like Redford to pull off a movie with no dialogue. 
Go see this amazing film.
it's about experiencing the feeling of having no control. whenever our feet 
are not on solid ground, we automatically feel some kind of 
fear/adrenaline. same with rollacoasters.

Congrats on Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.Ôªø
I have no idea how to feel about this movie. I don't hate it, and 
definitely don't love it, I JUST DON'T KNOW. I honestly can't decide how to 
feel about it.Ôªø
Cant believe i havent seen this! Ôªø
i was so disturbed but yet interested to keep watching this film... when it 
ended i just sat there thinking ''WHAT''?????Ôªø
This looks so imbecil, idiotic, and absurd I really want to watch it. Ôªø

Typical degenerate Hollywood movie.Ôªø
It is such a good movie and I LOVED IT!!!!Ôªø
so many amazing actors but this is the worst movie i've ever seen. do not 
watch it. unless you like sick humour. Ôªø
Ironic you'd think this movie would be great because of the numerous high 
profile actors but it was shit lool XD

They would be screwed if they had to fight against people with guns, tanks

Why does the hulk look so much different in this then in the Incredible

I'm probably the only guy saying this, but that scene of black widow 
standing still while something behind her is blowing up........, why? I 
know its supposed to be sexy, but why couldn't it have been a scene of her 
fighting. I doubt she would just stand still sexually while a battle is 
going on around her.Ôªø
As a trash little kid movie shoreÔªø
I watched it in theaters great movieÔªø
I love this movie. <3Ôªø
Roggers never speak of Starks dad who shearch for himÔªø
I maybe hating on Hollywood movies I mean I love the graphics and action 
and it's very exciting but sometimes I feel that these alien beings (in 
almost every American movie) that want to attack Earth ALWAYS attack New 
York City first and the ones protecting Earth ALMOST ALWAYS defend America 
instead of other countries making us want to assume that America IS the 
world. I MEAN COME ON! There are other cities and countries in the world 
LMAO!!! Or maybe it's the same old American propaganda bullshit distributed 
in these "cool" action movies.Ôªø
awsomeÔªø
2,5 years later.. this is a pretty bad trailerÔªø

The crash occurred about 5:40 p.m. Thursday on Interstate 5 north of 
Highway 32, when a FedEx semi-truck collided with a tour bus filled with 
high school students. Both caught on fire.

The bus was carrying students from several Los Angeles-area high schools to 
visit Humboldt State for its Spring Preview for prospective students today 
and Saturday. Three buses were traveling together but only one was involved 
in the crash.

As many as 10 ground ambulances and four helicopters were sent to the area 
to evacuate the injured. Authorities this morning said 31 people were 
transported to seven hospitals from Sacramento to Redding. There were 48 in 
the tour bus.

Southbound I-5 has reopened, but northbound lanes at the crash scene are 
still closed. A detour has been established.

At a press conference this morning, Glenn County Sheriff Larry Jones said 
it will be a difficult task to positively identify some of the victims in 
the charred wreckage.

Sheriff Jones said the last body was removed from the scene about 1:40 a.m. 
The FedEx truck was being removed at 8:15 this morning.

CHP Lt. Scott Fredrick from the accident investigation team said the 
investigation will take months to complete.

This movie is one of the worse I have seen. Funny, yes. Talent? No talent 
at all. None of the actors/actresses in this movie can sing apart from 
Anna, but even Anna isn't all that when it comes to singing. When I watched 
this movie, I was really bored and I felt as if I was watching a movie made 
by an amatuer. But all I know is, is that I am never going to watch this 
movie again because of how bad it is. It's funny, but that's the only good 
thing about this film. Ôªø
Whats the song in 0:53 not 0:52Ôªø
Oh. my. god... I cannot believe I watched this dumb movie till the end. The 
only merit are the songs... I mean... It's like the actors aren't even 
trying to ACT! 4 out of 10. For the stage performances.

Peeta was so young!! Omgeee I can't get over it!!Ôªø
Okay, I know this was out a long time ago, but this is seriously one of my 
favorite trailers ever!! ooh also, at 0:57 I always get the chills and 
THOSE FEELS!Ôªø
It's funny watching the first movie. Then Catching Fire which was AWESOME!Ôªø
So much action in the movieÔªø
Wish the movie was as good as this trailer made it seem :/Ôªø
*I think I may have been inadvertently hiding under a rock...*

I knew nothing about *The Hunger Games* until earlier today, when my wife 
brought the books to my attention, and tonight I've stumbled across this 
trailer that tells me she was absolutely right - the story is definitely 
right up my alley!Ôªø
Originally found by +George Rodenbaugh. Nice find man!Ôªø
I expect this movie will prove to be a huge hit:Ôªø
None
Happy hunger gamesÔªø

$$$$
looks like great film !Ôªø
The amount of times I've had to watch these trailers in media class for 
this god damned essay...Ôªø
the dark knight saga was one of the better superheroes movieÔªø
I remember when I went to go see the avengers on opening night and this 
trailer played before it along with Prometheus & Brave. Well let me just 
say that this fantastic trailer was the highlight of that night. Ôªø
At 1:05-1:07 Batman said "Nooo!!" :(Ôªø
Wonder if those are the same piano keys as the ones used to open the 
entrance to the batcaveÔªø
if joker was there he would help batman retake the city because he would be 
jealous of baneÔªø
People who say these movies suck are some of the dumbest fuckers I've ever 
seenÔªø
Somebody should make Batman 4Ôªø
Rebooting Batman is going to be really hard after Nolans trilogy the bar 
was raised beyond anything especially after the dark knightÔªø
I love this movie to death, but The Dark Knight is much better than movie.Ôªø
cant wait for a new batman franchise with terry mcginnis!!Ôªø
so far TDK and TDKR are both outstanding over any other superhero movie.Ôªø
I've never watched this until now. Such an amazing movie!Ôªø
I haven't watched this movie when it came out until now and all I can say 
is...
I've never cried in action movie until now. Words cannot describe how 
absolutely amazing this was!Ôªø
Damn, this was a bad movie. I mean, at least Spider-Man 3 was funny at 
being garbage.Ôªø
The ending made me cryÔªø
some people may have been underwhelmed by this movie - i thought it was 
about as good as it could have been given the circumstances, i thought it 
ended the trilogy brilliantly - but man, you have to admit, no matter what 
you think of the movie, what a GREAT trailer this was! almost as good as 
that epic trailer for the Dark Knight when it first came out. sends chills 
down my spine.Ôªø
'So you came back to die with your city?' Bane/Tom Hardy was phenomenal in 
this film. I preferred him over The Joker. My opinion so don't start 
moaning at me.Ôªø
This movie was amazing but I still give it to the Joker as best villain 
everÔªø
the dark knight trailer is WAY better than this
FULL HD
This FUCKING AMAZING film came out ages ago
a complete bastardization of Batman but at least nolan wasn't as stupid 
enough to use gender/race/sexual preference swapping like some other 
idiotic directors have done in other movies. yes, i'm actually giving nolan 
a complement, now.... the end of the world is nigh.
:) 
$$$$
one of the best movies of all time holy shit i cant believe i didnt watch 
it earlier. guess its never to late for a classic. jamie, leo and don were 
amazing.10/10 must watchÔªø
It's a movie, it's not racist. Characters can be racist, just as they can 
be murderer's, pyschopath's, rapists, sexist, etc. but they're characters, 
it's not real, it's just a story on a screen that's what films are, I don't 
see why people can see fiction as racist.Ôªø
shit.i just made mine worse. anybody bring any extra bags?Ôªø
Anyone who says this movie is racist, needs to remove their head from there 
ass and shut the fuck up.Ôªø
More hollywood bullshit to keep hatred, racial division, and the idea of 
white racists alive. I bet you anything no white people were watching this 
at any theater in a city. Unless of course you cried during the whole thing 
just so maybe the blacks thought you weren't racist and decide not to beat 
the shit out of you.Ôªø
Waltz was the only good thing that came out of this movie. Jamie Foxx had 
like 2 lines at a time and Leo was just too fucking evil. He's never had a 
role like that before.Ôªø
The "D" is silent so she'll never  hear it cumming ;) Ôªø
django unchained 2: The legend of Boss NiggerÔªø
cant wait for this movie to come out:DÔªø
Excellent anti white propaganda from the owners of hollywood. Have they 
ever made a film with a racist black or racist jew in it? I'd pay money to 
see it.Ôªø
His movies are getting more cartoon as he goes on. He keeps making 
incredibly stupid mistakes. Of course there are flashes of brilliance, but 
still. I still can't get over how he has the American with a baseball bat 
beat the Nazi to death in "Dirty Basterds.". What was the poiint of that? I 
thought the Nazis were supposed to be the monsters. Ôªø
This is not only the best western I've seen in a long time but this is my 
favorite Tarantino movie since Pulp Fiction.Ôªø
I have 11 years, but I love this movie! :DÔªø
Tge D is silent....come on,how does noone make a sex joke?!Ôªø
I cant find it on netflix or comcast ?Ôªø
The D is silent motherfucker!Ôªø
When white people on tv (Tony Soprano, anyone on FX, Walter White, Francis 
Underwood, e.t.c) kill a bunch of innocent people for no good reason 
(mostly greed) and enjoy it it's ok because they're anti-heroes they're 
allowed to kill innocent people we love them anyway.  But if a black guy 
kills a bunch of racist evil assholes who have ruined his life and he 
enjoys it that's wrong.Ôªø
Great film up until the German dude died .Ôªø
A must watch movie excellent.Ôªø
Do you sell years? Ôªø
L√§sst seinen Freund King Schultz einfach tot in der Scheune liegen,ohne ihn 
zu begraben! Was f√ºr n Freund! 
Why does the dumb yank christian cracki scum release it then? For money. 
White & black both are too greedy scum & both too racist. USA take 
responsibility you fucking racist piglets. What goes around comes around. 
Fuck off out of USA.
Theirs a difference between KKK and Nazi's you moron haha
He looks like Kevin Durant :D

I love this movie, could watch it twice in a row, and I have. But one thing 
that gets me is when people say Bead looks like he's a 40 year old, he 
looks like he's in high school. There's freshman in my HS who have legit 
beards and shadows, they look 40.Ôªø
I want Watch the 22 NOW¬° XD come in june Ôªø
I just noticed that guy from project x is in this movie . Ôªø

About to watch this. :DÔªø
Lol when did I get stabbed Ôªø
Shit! Can't wait for 22 jump streetÔªø
Funniest movie ever and also has a very smart scriptÔªø
The Funniest part is when Mr.Walters gets shot in the dickÔªø
22 is under awayÔªø
soo funnyÔªø
When I first saw trailers for this movie I initially wasn't that interested 
and thought it was gonna be a major flop and embarrassingly bad movie. 
Thank God for my sister's interest in Channing Tatum, when we and another 
friend of mine went to see this, we actually really enjoyed it and it 
became a favorite of ours. Didn't expect that at all. In fact, my friend 
and I still quote this movie on a regular basis. Ôªø
I have no strong feelings for this movie one way or the other. Ôªø
Lol the censored parts sound dumb but this movie was hilarious!Ôªø
Haha, makes me laugh all the timeÔªø
LolÔªø
awesome movie ,, super comedy movie all must see this movie ,, iam waiting

I actually loved this movie. I wish I could watch it again. Ôªø
Best movie EVER!<3 Spring break forever, bitches!Ôªø

Disney stars gone wild lol. I wil go see this movie if i get to see 
selena's tittiesÔªø
is a porno movie? i like XDÔªø
This is a perfect movieÔªø
i liked the message of the movie but now when i watched the trailer it 
looked like it could have been betterÔªø
i just don't know why
But I LOVED how this movie ended.
Swear I do <3
and I love how its in flashes
Flash forwards and flash backs
sighs 
It's so ....
I just love it <3Ôªø
this film was shit, nothing like it looks and selena gomez is in it for 
about 25 minutesÔªø
James Franco was VERY good in this movie. Ôªø
Gorgeously shot film! Didn't think I would like it from the previews, but 
ended up LOVING it! Harmony Korine is a mastermind! Ôªø
Oh look there goes my childhoodÔªø
This is maybe the worst movie ever made!! Soooo dissapointingÔªø
good movie but not much of a storylineÔªø
this is nothing i thought it would be.Ôªø
Do they show selenas titsÔªø
this films is kinda artsy,  its why your average movie audience may not 
enjoy this film, but if your willing to sit back and take it all in, you 
may acctually enjoy this film, i didnt expect much from this trailer, but 
it was worth a watchÔªø
does anyone know the song at 0:45?Ôªø
I didn't liked the movie , i thought it would be way better cuz i liked the 
trailer, but it had no message and it ended sooooo bad Ôªø
¬øNo sabias?Ôªø
Omg my childhood Ôªø
Trailer makes the movie look so good but it is fucking shit
Basically - they rob a store to get money for spring break
They get arrested 
James franco bails them and get them to do more crime
One by one they begin to get sick of it
They each go home 
Ôªø
This looks abousolt SHITÔªø
$$$$
its like i died and gone to 80s action movie heaven!

The guy is way to old for her.Ôªø
I didn't understand this movie :(Ôªø
I wish I could find my own Tiffany. She's like the perfect girl, guess 
that's why it's called a movie...Ôªø
it is better than i expected :) i love this movie!Ôªø
Definitely not an Eagles fan but just watched this movie for the first time 
and it's great!Ôªø
I love TiffanyÔªø
This is the movie that everyone was talking about? Really? Even the trailer 
is terrible. Ôªø
10/10Ôªø
"She is my friend with an 'f'"
"Capital F"
"...for friend"Ôªø
Hes just like "Ah, What the HELL??!!??" XDXDXDXDXDÔªø
I feel like they based the old grumpy guy in Up on Robert De Niro..Ôªø
best movie I've ever seen, not even exaggerating. Ôªø
This movie was soooo different from the bookÔªø
OMG ITS JENNIFER LAWRENCE!!!!!!Ôªø
the whole movies and great but the ending scene made me burst into tears

I know this movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy but I was bawling the 
whole damn time.

watching this a second time while I go through my hall closet. #ihatemoving Ôªø
Every once in a while a film comes along that is both original and 
memorable. 'Cloud Atlas' is one of these films and I enjoyed it to its 
finale. 

I recommend that my friends watch this film, you can find no film better 
than this. Ôªø
This movie was so boring and slow. I would not recommend it to anyone. It 
was not thought provoking at all and it was awkward to say the least. Some 
scenes were so out of place and forced I started laughing then became 
embarrassed for the creators. The trailer looks great, because... they used 
the most exciting 2 and a half minutes of the film, everything else is 
stupid. It's like the writers were all on drugs, bad drugs like saliva. 
Piece of crap. It had these racial references that were so forced it came 
off as okay, just pop a lower third on the screen that tells us that 
slavery is/was bad and gay sex is all about love. Well what do you expect 
from a man turned woman and in hollywood?Ôªø
Oh, I'm so going to watch this!Ôªø
it has gay porn in itÔªø
One of the best filmÔªø
So do you believe in reincarnation? Ôªø
Beautiful.Ôªø
Music: Sonera - Illusions (Thomas Bergersen)Ôªø
really bad movie!!! do not watch.Ôªø
this movie left a very strong impact on me, i thought about it for a very 
long time. Ôªø
If you are looking to see a truly inspiring movie this year, I 
highly recommend you see this.

"Cloud Atlas" explores how the actions and consequences of individual lives 
impact one another throughout the past, the present and the future. Action, 
mystery and romance weave dramatically through the story as one soul is 
shaped from a killer into a hero and a single act of kindness ripples 
across centuries to inspire a revolution in the distant future.Ôªø
This looks incredible!Ôªø
Cloud Atlas was fantastic. I need to go see it again. Ôªø
Wants to Check this movie out next week!  :DÔªø
PAST. PRESENT. FUTUTE. EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED.Ôªø
Well this looks good!!Ôªø

Q: Do bad thoughts in itself lead to bad karma?

A: Thoughts themselves have very little karmic trace, which however grows 
accumulatively when repeated, or even more when solidified into (verbal or 
internal silent) speech, and even furthermore when acted out into physical 
real world action.Ôªø
I liked it.... long but interesting.Ôªø

I spy with my little eye... an Arrogant Bastard Ale bike jersey in the 
trailer for Judd Apatow's upcoming movie, *This Is 40*! Ôªø
Knocked Up just got a kinda sorta sequel.Ôªø
The latest and not greatest from Judd Apatow // THIS IS 40Ôªø
New trailer for Judd Apatow's next film, "This is 40". It looks fun.Ôªø
This is 40 - Trailer#2Ôªø
I can't say I'd recommend it, but *This is 40* does not really deserve the 
grilling the critics give it. Sure, they're rich and have a lot of First 
World Problems, but these issues are largely agnostic of wealth (albeit 
scalable in nature). I can only assume the reviewers don't have children 
old enough to talk back. My one real complaint is that now I have seen a 
Megan Fox movie.Ôªø
Ahahahaha what a comedy and then with some drama! I laughed a lot :D 7,1/10Ôªø
I'm so confused by the political "debate" that's happening in the comments 
of a trailer to a heartwarming romantic comedy...
Much better than I expected but I think it is 20-30 minutes longer than it 
should be. Very funny though.
Have you seen my starfish? Where did I put my starfish? (Giggle)
this movie is sooooo bad i hated it so not funny no storyline nothing !! i 
couldn't even finish it although i love the actors and everything but the 
movie sucked 
This movie is almost two hours of anus
Thank you so much! :)
Idk but I didn't find it that funny. I mean, it was ok, but it really 
wasn't that gr8.

I remember when I was sixteen after seeing the movie Dirty Dancing I 
decided I wanted to be a Chippendales dancer when I grew up. Patrick Swayze 
had the most sexy moves, and he really inspired me to dance / strip. I got 
home after seeing the movie and put on the Dirty Dancing soundtrack. I had 
to practice my moves in the shower so my Mom wouldn't know what I was up 
too. I had the time of my life was blasting out of my boom box, and just as 
I screamed "Nobody puts baby in a corner!" I slipped on a bar of soap and 
went face first through the glass door! My nose was broken in three places, 
and I had two deep lacerations on my left buttock. My Mom heard me 
screaming and kicked open the door only to see me bloodied and naked. She 
yelled "Nobody may be putting baby into any corner, but I am putting you in 
the car to go to the emergency room!" Long story short, I am still not a 
Chippendales dancer, and my Mom made me pay for all the damage to the 
bathroom out of my chore money! : (Ôªø

Have you seen Prometheus yet?

You should...Ôªø
Well this trailer sure got annoying near the endÔªø
This trailer features the exact same sound design alarm/scream as the 1979 
trailer to Alien, I'm not sure if it was known that it was a (kind of) 
prequel to Alien before its release, however if it wasn't this is a nice 
subtle prerelease hint that the two films are linked :)Ôªø
Best sci fi script i knowÔªø
greatest trailer of all time and is my 10th fav movie of all time, great 
movie cant wait for the sequel Ôªø
I blame the movie being bad on this trailer. No movie could be as good as 
this trailer.Ôªø
The trailer just gave away the entire plot.Ôªø
TOSHIBA MEGAWA LORDS OF THE FIRAUNS NEMESIS.....THE LOST OF THE YEARS 2020 
CYBERJAYA.........................NATIONALIST LOST THE WARS IN THE YEARS 
1553Ôªø
Is anyone else excited to see Prometheus? This looks SO awesome. The ship 
in the trailer looks like the crashed ship they find in Aliens. I keep 
reading that it is not a prequel to Aliens, but that it happens in the same 
Universe. There is a Weiland character in it and several other tie ins. I'm 
kind of curious to see how closely related the movies are and if this will 
turn into a series that may be an Alien prequel?

This movie was ok
Nothing is more powerful then a young boys wish..... If that was true I

Okay???? I think thousands over 12 years old has seen this movie

woooh so much hatness for this bond movie, whats so wrong about it? yes it 
was different but in an awesome way, seeing his childhood, M's destiny, ex 
agent creepy villain and daniel craig being the most badass ever. it is 
seriously one of the best bonds.Ôªø
And by the way I get why the plot doesn't show how Bond survived and what 
happens to M later, because this movie was meant as a Prequel to show what 
happens first before it shows what happens next because Filmmakers didn't 
have time to show what happens with it because it was already up to 2 hour 
and 30 minute movie, because they may have lefted it for the Sequel which 
they improved that the next Bond film is a Skyfall Sequel!Ôªø
im sorry but i think i could do better than daniel craig did in this 
movie.But All you trolls out there think skyfall was the worst movie.The 
worst was Goldfinger 1964.
The best bond movie was Casino Royal.Ôªø
Very good trailer for a very bad movie.Ôªø
Worst James Bond movie ever and terrible accents this movie sucksÔªø
If you didn't like the movie, you should have seen it in IMAX. Ôªø
The worst Bond ever made it was so poncy and bleak and not one second of 
excitement. Bond is dead.Ôªø
just saw it on Netflix. Great movie :DÔªø
I also like Skyfall cause critcs keep saying oh bond is old, spying has 
changed in the modern area and the war on terror is handled by drones. Not 
excalty Skyfall is actually saying like M speech that the new enemies 
aren't organizations or countries. There what she said "Individuals"

Skyfall is basically saying the threat of today is Domestic Terrorism or 
Lone Wolf Terrorism. It is the terrorism we has a society tend to overlook 
completely and has Technology advances yes another threat Cyber terrorism 
is born. I hate when people say Skyfall is a generation film, I don't think 
so cause its relevant that whole speech of M made since. The enemies of 
today are Individual people committing acts on there own. Me personally 
Skyfall is a commentary on Domestic Terrorism being something we have to 
worry about more then Foreign Terrorism.     Ôªø
EPIC 007........Ôªø
Loveeee this movie! So much! My fav of 007Ôªø
And we want pierce brosnan ! Ôªø
Smh Daniel Craig has yet to use gadgets.....They making his too actioned 
pack with lackluster plot, and has yet to have a memorable villian like 
jaws, necros, or oddjob. Casino royale remains his best, glad they bringing 
back Q and Moneypenny because they are missed dearly. Ôªø
i dont know i didnt like this movie it just seemed boring to me really.. 
seemed pretty basic and typical and predictable . but thats just me Ôªø
Sean Connery's the best actor who played James BondÔªø
Traditionally, I've thought "Goldfinger" was the best Bond, followed by 
"From Russia With Love." I know a lot of folks will disagree with me, but I 
think "Skyfall" is the third best Bond. A more modern, darker, more ominous 
Bond. A Bond who has actually aged, something we all do. Less campy than 
earlier Bonds, more cynical. It's just my opinion, of course, but I like 
it.Ôªø
This is me, Love D.Ôªø
This bond had the worst ending and what the hell happened to the driveÔªø
rating?Ôªø
Best bond everÔªø
Liked the movie quite a bit. Now I'm writing a paper about this trailer for 
English haha.Ôªø
None
good 2 min trailer, bad 2 hour movie.Ôªø
None
A lot of the other bonds from the 60s had a contempory feeling to them such 
as the space race and weapons of mass destruction. During the 60s there was 
a lot of technological optimism because of computers and space travel and 
the growth of air travel. They may seem silly now but back then they were 
cutting edge. 
$$$$
The movie is a laughable pack of US liesÔªø
fucking cant stand ben affleck, hes a walking jaw.Ôªø
This is another good movie i should not have missed. What a regret! Ôªø
This movie really upset me because it was only one sided. It was only from 
the american perspective and this isnt the first movie where the usa and 
shit made Iran. First of it was so disrespectful the way that they talked 
about our shah in the beggining of the movie. How dare they. No one would 
ever be allowed to talk about the president or queen on england that way! 
Then they made us look like fucking terrorists, I live in sweden when after 
seeing this movie with my persian friend we had to walk with heads down 
from the cinema. I was so disgusted by this movie, maybe its a good movie 
for outside people but it made me lose all respect for everyone in this 
movie and the united states, seriously obama leave Iran alone.Ôªø
Bryan Cranston!Ôªø
Excellent movie! Good enough to watch again. Ôªø
ARGO FUCK YOURSELF!! Brilliant movie. Last years must see!Ôªø
Ôªø
Loved this movie! Ôªø
Oscars 2013 Prep | *Argo*

I give it a 9/10. Who would have thought that Ben Affleck would become such 
a great director? I'm far from being a fan of his acting career choices and 
performances, but so far he's not disappointed me as a director. Argo took 
a story from a declassified CIA story happening in the US Embassy of Iran. 
Taken under siege with all staff held hostages for months, the CIA plans a 
rescue mission for six diplomats who escaped and hid in the Canadian 
Embassy. The movie is about the quite original rescue mission. From the 
moment you realize that the hidden diplomats are not in security at the 
Canadian embassy, the stress level rises and your hands will grasp your 
seat, eyes wide open looking staring obsessively at the screen as to not 
miss a second of it. It's really, really intense. I tried talking to my 
wife for a second but got a quick "shhhhh!" for a reply. No talking, no 
cuddling, there's just no space and time for that. It's that effective, and 
it's that good.

Most awaited!Ôªø
Little late to the party.. but nonetheless

Argo, must watch movie.. Holds the tension till the last shot! Watertight 
direction! No wonder it got Oscars..

I knew the story beforehand, and yet, the movie managed to make me feel 
this strongly about it. Kudos.Ôªø
#TIFF is kicks off in 3 days!! Lots of films I'll be keeping an eye such as 
#ARGO from Ben Affleck Ôªø

Oscar Winner for Best Movie (2013): Argo 
INDEED WELL DESERVED!!!
A MUST WATCH!!!Ôªø
Trailer:
Title: "ARGO"
Cinematography by: RODRIGO PRIETO / ASC, AMCÔªø
Just saw this movie, and it WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
*Wow!* Now I have to convince my roommates, friends and colleagues that 
*all* Iranians are not that dangerous potential fundamentalist brutal devil 
bastards, but some are!

*P.S.*
http://youtu.be/TwIyLHsk2h4Ôªø
Honestly, I came into this movie with so-so expectations as the trailer I 
saw in a different movie made me give myself a 50% chance to watch it, up 
in the air if you will. But from the moment the movie began up until the 
end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should 
be.  I expected Argo to be a good movie, but I did not expect it to be an 
enjoyable one. Ben Affleck did a spectacular job directing this film, which 
pretty faithfully follows such an unbelievable story. Every actor is 
convincing as his/her character and the cast was impeccably chosen. Make 
sure you stay in the theater to watch the credits. You'll see some real 
photographs and clips that mirror Affleck's film and actors. I really liked 
the fact that Affleck shot the movie in the usual 35mm in order to make the 
movie feel like the 1970s. He then cut the frames in half, and blew those 
images up 200% to increase their graininess. He also made the right choice 
by mirrioring camera movements and bustling office scenes from All the 
President's Men for sequences depicting CIA headquarters while for L.A. 
exteriors, he borrowed from The Killing of a Chinese Bookie. Argo also 
recreates the volatile environment of world affairs when relief from 
Vietnam did not mean relief from rogue governments like Iran's, as the 
condemnation of Salman Rushdie has taught well. Every Iranian bureaucrat 
and soldier carries a hidden threat in beards and bearing. At the airport, 
the multiple check points ramp up the anxiety, enhanced no doubt by our 
experiences with post 9/11 TSA. This film is a golden example in its own 
right. Movies based on true stories don't get more compelling than this. 
Despite some incredibly suspicious timing as far as avoiding the bad guys 
and other stuff we're more accustomed to from works of total fiction, this 
film represents a crisp, clean and maybe most importantly, accessible 
execution of a bureaucratic thriller, especially one based on true events. 
The delivery of the story is so impeccable that it ought to be used to 
teach writing for film. We don't ask all our films to be revelatory, but 
they should all be as thoroughly engaging as "Argo.". Must watch <3Ôªø

The end was so strange..Ôªø
What a fucking gay ass movie, dont waste your time, as soon you see 25min 
of it your gonna be like wow what a fucking waste starts out good at first 
but then it gets so fucking gayyyyy as in fucking retarded.Ôªø
I'm a HUGE movie geek but NO horror fan by any means. I like about 3-4 of 
'em and of course wasn't into this one. But after remembering Joss Whedon's 
name was attached I had to check it out and WHAT A MOVIE! Probably close to 
the top list of not only my horror picks but also one of the best films 
I've seen in a long time. I'd give it a 9/10. As a non-horror fan that's a 
big deal for me. Check this film out.Ôªø
this movie is so metaÔªø
This movie is so insensitive to tobacco chewing rednecks!Ôªø
The main theme about this movie is illuminati and how the goverment has 
cages with all types of creatures that pepole in the usa should not 
discover Ôªø
THOR!!!!!!!!!!!!Ôªø
This movie fucked my brain in the ass 10/10Ôªø
HOLY SHITÔªø
Wow. Just saw this. And let me tell u. It. Is. Phenomenal. Horrifying, 
psychotic, mysterious, and twisted. I recommend this extremely Ôªø
My favorite movie! Man so many twists and turns!Ôªø
So much hate in this comments section for this movie. You guys need to 
relax, in the end it was just enjoyable. There were bits I didn't like too 
like how i thought the druggie was a little bit too much but i still 
enjoyed the movie. And don't give up after the first 25 minutes PLEASE. And 
to that guy who seems to be commenting on a ton of comment chains that this 
is bad and to never ever watch it, please go and read some pain-worshipping 
redneck girl's diary please.Ôªø
worst movie everÔªø
This is one of the most unexpected horror films I've ever seen... It's very 
different and very unique in a way which makes it so diverse from the other 
horror films..... I love itÔªø
its the hunger games with more scary stuffÔªø
R21 .... so violent and so many fucking and flirting parts the only great 
part is the storyÔªø
One of the worst movies I've ever seenÔªø
I have seen cabin in the woods.Ôªø
I almost didn't watch this because I thought it was another dumb gore-fest 
"Saw" movie. But a friend said I really should see it. So I checked it on 
Netflix and only then did a realize it was from Joss Whedon and had Fran 
Kranz in it. It was a really unique take on the genre and I was glad I 
finally watched it.Ôªø
I saw masky!! Kool awesome.. but I already saw it...Ôªø
highly recommend this movie.
even though it isn't the scariest movie made recently, its like a big 
tribute to the horror genreÔªø
whats the song at: 0:06 ?Ôªø
One of the biggest pieces of shit I've ever seen. Don't believe the hype 
because this movie sucks.Ôªø
The trailer ruined the movie so badly. The movie is so freaking cool.Ôªø
First, its a scary movie, second, it's a sci fi movie, third it's a fantasy 
movie.Ôªø

You can't fight me, you're miniature!

This movie came out first than "friends with benefits"?
It is a romantic comedy. They are all like this.

Uuuuuuum ok? What the hell was that comment/s below me?!?!
OMG NICK MILLAR!
$$$$
i love this and kristen stewart is with emma watson,jennifer lawrence  the 
best actress ‚ô•Ôªø
Kristen is sexy and best actressÔªø
Such an amazing trailer...such a disappointment trailer!Ôªø
 The trailer  was great, but the movie was bad, especially in the end when 
snow white was turned into a knight. And the drunken mirror on the wall. I 
mean The queen was so much more beautiful than snow white. Kristen is nice 
but she has just one expression. The only good thing in this movie was 
Charlize Theron. Amazing woman and gorgeous actres.Ôªø
Seriously?? Kristen Steward as Snowwhite? They seem to have forgotten that 
SnowWhite is the fairest of them all. That means you find an actrice who's 
at least able to close her mouth. Or able to smileÔªø
If you havent watched this movie and plan to, just skip to the credit part. 
Its the best trust me.Ôªø
I don't understand why people complain, it's still one of the best movies I 
have ever watched.Ôªø
i havent see movie yet i agree that they may pick somebody else maybe that 
girl that play i other version of snow white she was so beatiful so 
innosent but that be strange i think they pick kris because of twiligth 
suces they want fans to pay attension and they pick her annostly in the 
movie kristen is way move cute than twiligth and abouth that with the story 
maybe than for some people wh know the fairy tale is bullshit but i find it 
intresting to make somethink new of ours fav fairy tale s yes maybe those 
movie arent perfevt and have somethink that havent done quet rigth but its 
not that bad that some of the people sayÔªø
this is the first movie made on Snow White story where is Evil Queen more 
pretty than Snow White,no offence for Kristen but that's what I tkink
And Lily Colins would be much better Ôªø
Would have been better if anyone other than Kristen Stewart was playing 
Snow White.Ôªø
a singer Inna has a song "wow", in her video Inna plays snow white.Ôªø
This movie is so underrated. A fantastic and breathtaking performance given 
by Charlize Theron as well as Kristen Stewart. The cinematography and 
graphic effects were incredible, and I loved the unique storyline. Such a 
good film.Ôªø
Wow charlizeÔªø
I always watch this never get tired of it <3Ôªø
"Kristen is the best actress" 
I am sorry but she plays always the same. She's good but I personally 
dislike her. She looks like she's always dying and she's always kinda out 
of life. They should have chosen someone else as Snow White... Someone 
brighter! Ôªø
I don't see why Charlize Theron character feels threatened by kristen 
Stewarts, Charlize is way more beautiful Ôªø
Oh no I felt so sad for the queen :( and please tell me there's going to be 
a sequel! It can't end like that! She has to marry someone! (The Huntsman!)Ôªø
i didn't see this in theaters but i've seen it on tv and it wasn't that 
bad, the things i disliked most about the film were the queen's creepy 
brother and the fairies in the forestÔªø
What can I say about this movie...
The camera work was epic... The fairy forest with the white deer was 
perfect and epic. The magic of the evil queen was epic. 
Charlize Theron did a perfect job I loved her evil queen and
Chris Hemsworth did also a great job! Music was great to and I loved the 
fact that the movie gave you an LotR feeling.
But the story itself was overhasty and missed some dept. Some unimportant 
scene's was giving to much time and it would be nice if they had giving 
some other parts of the movie more dept.  

I don't want to talk about Kristen Stewart. 
I don't know is she is a good actress or not because I haven't see an other 
movie (except twilight 1, which I hated and because of this didn't watched 
the other parts) with her. But she failed as Snow White. I just couldn't 
buy it. Maybe it was because of her character of because of the actress. Ôªø
Who love Snow White ? watch this trailer of me!!!Ôªø
OMG !! Kristen StewartÔªø
OMG... she smiled...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kristen_Stewart_2,_2012.jpgÔªø
what?
Did she just forget to say She's White as Snow...
one word.....Twilight
$$$$
And the town will never look at him the same way again! Ôªø
 God bless the director for this movie, it shows just how easy a life can 
be ruined.Ôªø
Lesson of the story: If Klara wants the D, you give the D or else you'll 
suffer for the rest of your life. In all seriousness though, I thought the 
film was really good. It was quite heartbreaking I cried all through the 
whole second half of the film. Mads Mikkelsen was good as always. 7/10Ôªø
And thas why he plays hannibal ;), not so much good acting from the other 
actors thou but still enjoyableÔªø
One of the very few movies that has made me cry. It shows how weak our 
minds are, how easy is to manipulate opinion without valid evidence and 
proof, regardless of the maturity of people. A word and a feeling can 
quickly rip a life apart Ôªø
A billion more times powerful than orphan:/Ôªø
What is the name of that music, if it has a name, that starts at 1:04? 
Anyone tell me. I must know!Ôªø
Mads was great in this film. Great story. Recommend to anyone. Ôªø
SHOW THEM WHO YOU ARE LECTER.........SHOW THEMÔªø
good mocie to watch... great storyÔªø
MrKajithecat1: 
"This is what happens when people jump to conclusions. Lives get ruined."

That's what happens when people lie. The girls can't be really blamed for 
all this because she does not understand what she did. But for example when 
the mother actually convinces her girl that it did happen. Now what would 
happen if a mother did that in a custody battle out of spite and just 
because she's evil; convince her kids that their father hurt them and 
abused them and it was so terrible that they just can't remember? Everyone 
including his family would grow up hating him and for nothing. That shit 
happens.Ôªø
Review of The Hunt
This week has been a pretty good LoveFilm experience what with the Bosch 
pilot and a Blu-ray of this Danish subtitled film. Having enjoyed other 
Danish movie and TV productions though being unfamiliar with the director I 
was looking forward to watching this film. After having done so now I am 
not so sure because it tackles the always contentious matter of child abuse 
by professionals we entrust our loved ones to. Anyway, here is what I wrote 
for Lovefilm reviews.
I I watched this movie for the main actor/victim Mads Mikkelson who seldom 
disappoints. He does a fine job portraying a very troubled man who is 
sucked into a vile conspiracy that would drive some to desperate measures. 
The film is therefore a troubled watch and given that for the most part it 
is subtitled and two hours long it might not suit everyone. However...
Having watched it and read many reviews of it I had to offer my contrary 
opinion. I did enjoy the movie if that is what you do with what is a 
voyeuristic trip into the near-destruction of a nice guy. Schadenfreude 
also creeps in because I for one could not completely dismiss two notions. 
One that he was at least in part guilty of something and two that something 
WAS going on. Something vile in the family of his best friend. And I don't 
know whether this was intentional, bad plotting etc or just me. That is 
what troubles me about this film; several times I found myself thinking 
that something is flawed about this plot. OK, life can sometimes run out of 
control but there are two critical moments about 30-40 minutes into the 
film where believability and so on are stretched a little too much. In 
particular the headmistress and her social worker chum. But there are other 
times when I wondered what an earth was going on. OK these are Danes not 
Brits so maybe they get more emotional in different ways. But their 
hostility made me wonder if there was some dark secret lurking beneath 
their apparent chumminess and safe, middle-class community. And how quickly 
most of these long-time pals turn on one of their own. I could only think 
that this is a cinematic device, to gloss over certain things and engineer 
the plot to ensure a point is made. OK, I accept that but I do in part 
resent what I felt was a little more than the usual manipulation was going 
on.
Finally, I was disappointed with the last section. You can find out for 
yourself but it does not match up with the tough middle part and left me 
feeling dissatisfied. The real point is that there can be smoke without 
fire but a stain will be left that time will not erase. And all from over 
emotional reactions by two females and a vulnerable man.
The Blu-ray looks good but has no extras which is a shame because a 
director's commentary would be a great help. I particularly liked the one 
you got with Felicia's Journey another disturbing film.
Here is the trailer.
The Hunt Official Trailer #1 (2013) - Mads Mikkelsen Movie HDÔªø
Even the trailer made me breathless. Go for the Oscar!Ôªø
Epic trailerÔªø
it was such a good film, but it made me feel comfortable all the time, lol. 
(spoilers) like everything klara did and said made me so embarrassed for 
lucas, like "and he has a willie" "yeah, most men do..." "yes, but his 
stick straight out. like a rod" i'm like nooooÔªø
If you've watched the TV show Hannibal or seen the movie A Royal Affair, 
then you know how to say "hot" in Danish: Mads Mikkelsen. Here's the 
trailer for his new movie, The Hunt. http://youtu.be/ieLIOBkMgAQ #stashit Ôªø
Ôªø
I just wanted to point out that even I, an amateur in child psychology, 
know that you are not supposed to imply an answer and nudge children in the 
assumed direction. When the counselor or whatever he was was asking Klara 
questions, he clearly handled it quite poorly. Klara clearly hated to be 
called a liar so she just went along with whatever he was saying. I really 
hope this is not how things work in the real world. Great movie though, 
illogicality aside.Ôªø
amazing. watch movies at: iwantmovies.info
LOL
Trailer is interesting. I might go see this movie. I love international 
films. 
An innocent and all around nice guy who works at a pre school gets accused 
of molesting a girl. People treat him badly.
so this is why hannibal went crazy.
the shot hit the tree, not Hannibal.

let me know what you THINK !!Ôªø
Seen it a few times on cable...don't quite get the references to 
telekinesis though. Like it didn't seem like what was driving the movie. 
Not a bad movie, overall.Ôªø
I hope I marry an asian women as beautiful as his. asian women are the most 
beautiful creatures on earth Ôªø
This seems cool, might watch it.Ôªø
Watched the movie already in class. It was good. Joseph was awesome:)Ôªø
it's a bloody amazing film you should watch itÔªø
+Liz Park and I are about to watch Looper! Ôªø
Wow.Ôªø
Joseph Gordon-Levitt again :)Ôªø
Starting from the trailer, it looks very interesting. Like someone said in 
YouTube comments it's a mix of Inception and Die Hard. rsÔªø
This looks like it's worth seeing in the theater. Ôªø
Excited to catch LOOPER this Friday with +Michael Ares. "A mind-bending 
masterpiece that's a must for more cerebral fans of the time-travel genre."Ôªø

That "Rihanna Movie" in the title is so pathetic. Did she made the movie? 
Is she the main character in the movie? No and no. Look we dont give a shit 
about what pop star is in the movie as long as the movie is good people 
will watch it.I feel like they added Rihanna just for the movie to get more 
popular.  Of course shes not that bad of an actress but shes not good 
either.Ôªø

A okay movie with a misleading trailer.Its isn't all that meets the eye it 
has a catch of drinking, a tad of romance and drugs.Parts of it is really 
not appropriate for children.The acting is top notch and the flight scene 
is awesome.This movie will make anyone think twice before getting on a

trailer.But a bit higher for the great acting.Ôªø

Is it just me, or ia this movie eerily similar to what just happened IRL? 
 In the movie, this giant plane CRASH LANDS, the tail rips off, and only 
two people die. !?!?!?Ôªø
Good movie Ôªø
ÈªëÂΩ±Â∏ùÁâáÂ≠êÔºåÊÄª‰ª§‰∫∫ÊúüÂæÖ....Ôªø
I just watched an awesome movie. With Training Day (witch I will watch 
later I think), one of his best performances.Ôªø
I love Denzel.

Flight Official Trailer [HD]: Denzel Washington, James Badge Dale and John 
GoodmanÔªø
Denzel Washington, commercial plane flying upside down, and flight 
attendants. November, watch this!Ôªø
Films I'm looking forward to (in no particular order)
3 - FlightÔªø
The older I get, the more I like Denzel. Not quite sure why.Ôªø
Flight looks like another great movie from Denzel Washington :)
I bet he did that maneuver a million time in MS Flight Simulator!! :DÔªø
None
Does Denzel ever do a bad movie? Looks good.Ôªø

Looper (2012)
My brief opinion here : 
http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/2013/08/looper-2012.htmlÔªø
Anybody knows the song from 0:56 - 1:08Ôªø
2:01 WubwubuwubuwbuwbuwÔªø
Trailer gives away WAY too much...Ôªø
what's the song?Ôªø
"when did I go completely bald?"  "why is there still no cure?"Ôªø
 #looper   #timetravel  Ôªø
This movie was AWEsome! I have never watched a movie four times ever and 
then just days apart....this one just blew me away!!! I guess I should add 
though that I have never seen a Batman movie so I might be back to rephrase 
this lol.Ôªø
Here because of Cracked.Ôªø
yes ray looper is an amazing movie :DÔªø
name of the song pleas  2:01Ôªø
000000000Ôªø
11:20 AMÔªø
I have just watched Looper and I give it 8/10 Good film, Check it Out and 
let me know what you THINK !!Ôªø
Seen it a few times on cable...don't quite get the references to 
telekinesis though. Like it didn't seem like what was driving the movie. 
Not a bad movie, overall.Ôªø
I hope I marry an asian women as beautiful as his. asian women are the most 
beautiful creatures on earth Ôªø
This seems cool, might watch it.Ôªø
Watched the movie already in class. It was good. Joseph was awesome:)Ôªø
it's a bloody amazing film you should watch itÔªø
+Liz Park and I are about to watch Looper! Ôªø
Wow.Ôªø
Joseph Gordon-Levitt again :)Ôªø
Starting from the trailer, it looks very interesting. Like someone said in 
YouTube comments it's a mix of Inception and Die Hard. rsÔªø
This looks like it's worth seeing in the theater. Ôªø
Excited to catch LOOPER this Friday with +Michael Ares. "A mind-bending 
masterpiece that's a must for more cerebral fans of the time-travel genre."Ôªø

For God and country: Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo. 




Geronimo EKIA.Ôªø
Too much tinfoil in the comment section.Ôªø
Good movie, the SEAL raid is only the last part of it, it is mainly about 
the female CIA agent and her hunt over the years for UBL.Ôªø
Tip ... Bavilo a moc ;)Ôªø
Sigh. A well crafted movie. Deserves more praise. Sucks that biased 
close-minded fools don't appreciate it and are so quick to call it 
propaganda or bull shit. Sure plenty of it is fabricated, but, honestly, 
it's well grounded in reality and doesn't assert America as superior in any 
way, it's simply a dramatic view on a historical account from the view of 
Americans.Ôªø
Addictive Movie. Watched in Cinema and Watched today for the second time. 
Miss chastain..OMGGGGGÔªø
Bin Laden terrified America for 6 years and in the last woman comes and 
stick with it ... this is a jokeÔªø
Bullshit american goverment hollywood crapÔªø
I saw it a while ago and I thought it was a pretty good movie. Accurate or 
not.Ôªø
I SHIT BETTER MOVIES THAN THIS Ôªø
What's the name of the song from 1:55 to the end?Ôªø
...well well wellÔªø
2/3 of this movie was unnecessary. There was nothing exciting watching a 
bunch of al Qaeda members questioned or Maya chasing a dead end. I get that 
they wanted to make this historically accurate or whatever, but this was 
advertised as an action movie not a documentary. Besides, Bin Laden was 
most likely dead long time ago. Ôªø
just a other stupid pro american movie.Ôªø
Bin Laden is a joke !Ôªø
this is the funniest movie ever lol i loughed so hard my tears came out,aww 
ya and this movie is FUCKING BULLSHIT AND A LIE THATS NEVER HAPPEN LOLÔªø
Saints Row IV brought me hereÔªø
Great movie, and unusually accurate in it's portrayals of world eventsÔªø
uuummm anyone gonna say sumthng bout da actual movie or......????Ôªø
Film Quote of the Day:

"Can I be honest with you? I am bad news. I'm not your friend. I'm not 
gonna help you. I'm gonna break you. Any questions?"

- Zero Dark Thirty (2012)Ôªø
For a decade, an elite team of intelligence and military operatives devoted 
themselves to a single goal: to find and eliminate Osama bin Laden. But 
instead they killed this random farmer dude and told the world that they 
just eliminated the most dangerous man in the world.Ôªø
This was a really good spy movie that just happened to be about Bin Laden.  
Taking political lessons from this movie would be like taking political 
lessons from Hunt for Red October or any other Hollywood spy thriller.  
Hint: you dont because it's just entertainment. Ôªø
$$$$
Reliance had a hand in this? So when are we going to get that Dredd/Singham 
crossover?Ôªø
That is the girl from Juno! 
I knew I recognized her.Ôªø
Let's see how this one is.Ôªø
What made Dredd badass,is because he didn't show any 
emotions(happy,sad,mercy) he just did the job he had to do. And the 
Rookie....well she is hot and good shooter !!! Movie was VERY GOODÔªø
What is the song in the beginning?Ôªø
I would love to see another instalment of this film Karl Urban did a very 
good job.Ôªø
great movie reminds me of the comic 2000ad I read as an 11 year old ..
this is how its done Stallone..Ôªø
I enjoyed this version of Dredd, it still hasn't captured the absurd 
satirical dark humour of the comics, but it worked as a film. I really hope 
they get round to a trilogy.Ôªø
The movie is badass! Great shooting scenes, a bunch of one-liners, no 
cheesy interludes. No depth to the characters, Dredd is Dredd, the psychic 
girl Anderson judge-in-training does what one would expect her to do. A lot 
of fun!Ôªø
ORLOK!Ôªø
Utorrent open the piratebay up :)Ôªø
Considering the facts that I found the original laughable and that I 
watched this movie right after seeing "The Raid: Redemption", to say that I 
wasn't expecting much is an understatement. So imagine my surprise when the 
credits rolled and all I could think of was "holy shit, that was amazing!". 
Most underrated movie of 2012.Ôªø
best film ever still watching it  2years after release   i want more DREDDÔªø
This movie was great and badass cause of dredd himself.... They put wayy 
too much attention into the whole slowmo drug thing as if the movie was 
about that. The whole drug thing was stupid, this movie was amazing because 
of many factors but the main one was Judge Dredd. Ôªø
Seeing people talk about how the raid copied dredd or whatever, and after 
watching both the trailers to me the raid is like a more modern day dredd 
and dredd is a more sci fi like the raid me personally I'm not into much 
sci fi stuff so I'd choose the raid over dredd but I can't officially say 
because I haven't seen either one of them lolÔªø
This trailer was awful. Great movie, though. I really do think that this 
terrible trailer is what killed this movie. The trailer made it look like 
the corniest movie of all time...Ôªø
I've never seen such blatant plagiarism in my life. They should have saved 
the money & done a voice over.Ôªø
Ok, cool movie ! but only one question that will ruin the movie. I 
understand the anti-atomic building but why do you have only one elevator 
in a 200 story building with 75 000 people living in it ?!Ôªø
I like at the end of the movie where he says CONFIRMED NOTICED and throughs 
mamma out of the buildingÔªø
This movie sucked balls!

The first one was good tough.Ôªø
I still prefer Stallone being Dredd. He is much more badass looking.Ôªø
this movie f***ing awesomeÔªø
wow, great movie, shitty trailerÔªø
Bloodseeker is that you?Ôªø
EPIC.THATS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.....
$$$$
i enjoyed this movie.. good acting ,and tom hardy was really good in this 
movie and also in his other movie "warrior".......Ôªø
I assume about probably 90% of people who searched, "Lawless trailer" on 
Youtube wanted to see a more in depth look at the movie before they wasted 
2 hours on watching it...oh, sorry...what I basically meant to say was all 
you people who give this and other movies away in the comments section are 
either a-holes are just plain stupid and ignorant. (i don't care, still 
watching it) Just use some common sense people...smhÔªø
He dies in the end by drinking way to much and falling in a lake? Ôªø
I remember one time, when I was living in LA, I left an old dressing-up box 
full of Gangster noir costumes out on the curb to be collected by the 
rubbish men. But before they got there, I spotted John Hillcoat and Nick 
Cave nosing through it. I said they could have it, with the proviso that 
they somehow worked in naked Jessica Chastain into the resulting film. Done 
and done.Ôªø
love the movie love the cast . Shia love him the tranformers Ôªø
Loved this movie the best part was the end of Charlie RakesÔªø
Such an amazing movie!!!!Ôªø
Great movie...nice to see the city slicker lose in the end..." It doesn't 
matter how high the crow flies, you can still break a window with an axe", 
" Sure hope the rain don't spoil the rhubarb "Ôªø
One of the best movies ever. really makes you think about life and the 
short time we have here. a must watch.. thank you all partys in the making 
of this  brilliant film.Ôªø
Great movie, ending is fabulous Ôªø

Best movie ever! love this!!!!Ôªø

Lawless - Official Trailer (HD)Ôªø
Lawless (2012)
116 min  -  Crime | Drama  -   Rated R
Ratings: 7.3/10 from 51,521 users   Metascore: 58/100 

Set in Depression-era Franklin County, Virginia, a bootlegging gang is 
threatened by a new deputy and other authorities who want a cut of their 
profits.

Director:John Hillcoat
Writers:Nick Cave (screenplay), Matt Bondurant (novel)
Stars:Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf and Guy PearceÔªø
For the most part I stay the hell out of Franklin County.  The parts of it 
I have passed through seem to *me* the way *all* of the south seems to a 
Yankee.  But I think we're gonna go see this movie today.  Gary Oldman, Tom 
Hardy and Guy Pierce in a movie "based on a true story," that takes place 
just a few miles down the road, is bound to be worth a look.Ôªø
Lawless review. Saw it tonight, other than a few naked scenes that ill 
never understand why they need that, It was really good and worth seeing at 
the theater. The ending was really well done. Ôªø
Ive had my eye on this one for awhile. Its gonna be pretty dang good.Ôªø
Watching LawlessÔªø
Thanks for everyone who has had a look at my Joy Formidable review. Here's 
my Movie of the Day! This film has violence in perfect proportion.  #Lawless Ôªø
I was told by several people that this was a good movie, so I gave it a 
shot. The acting, production design, and music was superb. It had a good 
cast. The story was terrible. It was disjointed, had too many loose ends, 
and just kind of ended. The pacing was off and Gary Oldman's character was 
completely useless. I do not recommend this film. Ôªø
Lawless (2012) http://www.forfun.org.ua/?p=4208Ôªø
Yyyeaahhaaaaa and hibbedihooo! Well I can imagine in that times there might 
have been some more ruthless types but the movie itself is very nice. The 
accent though - until I got used to it I needed subtitles :/Ôªø
this looks quite entertainingÔªø
this looks brilliant! Lawless - Official Trailer (HD)
#lawless  Ôªø
Put Tom Hardy, Gary Oldman, Jessica Chastain, and Guy Pearce into a movie 
and what do you get? A great cast. Add Shia LaBeouf, and Mia Wasikowska in 
for good measure and you really have a recipe for some great acting.

*Lawless* looks to be dramatic, daring, and deadly. So full of 
alliterations it's awesome.

Don't u guys remember when he was in high school musical at age 14 throw 18 
and know he's 24 he has a wonderful career ahead of him.
@selena2613 You found me- The Fray
Zac looks unbelievably fucking amazing holy shit. FREAKIN NICHOLAS SPARKS, 
his movies use the hottest freaking guys.
Here is the million dollar question is Zac naked in this movie? who has 
seen an early screening and where can I go to see it.
Wow!!! He grew up and became a fine looking man!!! He's not the gangly 
little high schooler singing and dancing anymore!!! Don't get me wrong, I 
liked him in comedy, but I could get used to this!!! :)
it looks like a good movie. i cant wait 2 see it!!
His hair should be long.
Taylor Schilling is only three years older than Zac Efron. Three years is 
not a big deal, so calm down everyone.
I love Zac Efron, but honestly he is not good at acting. I really hate to 
say it, cause I really respect the guy. And every movie that he has done 
since High School Musical has been smushy and romantic like and it's been a 
bummer. I thought this was going to be a action movie.
If this is anything like Zac's last movie (Charlie St. Cloud) then this too 
will suck
.....this was completely unexpected
fuckn chick movie
love it!!!!
Another movie trailer wich shows the whole movie in a couple of minutes. 
Thank you. I don't have to see it and spend my money anymore.
@RSRlover4life I hope they just dont ruin the book!!!!
@kristinamednasa Embrace - Celebrate 
sexy zac damn u blonde girl!
Zac Efron's a tiger...grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr x)
I would like to know who the music
@daniboo9811 I did die.
Great. Love story
Anyone know the song at 01:40?? thx
yeah but she looks somewhat like 6 years older in this trailer if you ask 
me.
ohhh myyyy!since when Zac Efrom is so hottttttt?!;oo
@LaughingAshley18 You found me by the fray
$$$$
a film about the internet and not one rainbow or unicorn in the 
trailer.....sad face :(Ôªø
Saw this movie last night and I have to say I was really impressed with the 
story line and actors. Great movie!
+Franz Critchlow have you seen it? Ôªø
Great movie and definition Ôªø
Interesting.Ôªø
and thta is why I don't go on social mediaÔªø
THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!

Was it on theaters??

if you like this I recommend Prisoners with Hughes Jackman, excellent movie 
as well.Ôªø
Two swedes in one movie.. I gotta see this, I love alexander. Ôªø
THIS MOVIE IS EXCELLENT!!

It shows how fathers tend to forget the most valuable things in life and 
how people do harm onto other's without meaning.

Great movie over all.Ôªø
One of those movies that really gets you to think.Ôªø
Fantastic movie great performances all around my favorite performancw was 
from Mr. Bateman this guy brought me to tears in this film and I wish he 
would do more serious roles because he is great at itÔªø
+Rainy Jane I disagree. If you watch the movie the husband (ex marine) 
didn't solve anything but made the problem worst and the wife make her 
husband stop the bad thing that will happen. Also the husband (Jason 
Bateman) didn't think straight while his daughter already said that the one 
who done it to his brother is not important anymore. Females have more weak 
emotions I think that's why you see them cry easily while males keep it 
themselves. So saying automatically incompetent is kinda foul or offensive.Ôªø
whats the name of the song in bacground does anyone know?Ôªø
This movie made ‚Äã‚Äãme cryÔªø
what's the name of the 2nd song ? I love trailer music :)Ôªø
This movie left my heart aching, but it was SO AMAZING. Even if this is not 
your "type" of movie (mine are horror films) STILL PLEASE WATCH IT. So 
touching, I cried a lot. Jason Bateman, Alexander Skarsgard, Jonah Bobo, 
Colin Ford, Max Thierot, Paula Patton just a few of the amazing 
actors/actresses in this movie. Definitely one of the best films I have 
watched in my entire life, its right up there on my list also with the 
movie Prisoners with Hugh Jackman. Please watch this movie!Ôªø
what is the name this music??Ôªø
NOW THIS IS A MOVIE !!!!!Ôªø
damn bitcoins.Ôªø
Does anyone know the song at the start!?Ôªø
This movie was just insane!
I absolutely loved it!
The ending was a masterpiece (slow-mo scene)Ôªø
So its kinda like "Traffic" were different people's like so how 
intertwined. It looks really goodÔªø
theres like 3 stories in one if not and it all links together could someone 
kindly explain it to me id really like to knowÔªø
So 4chan the movie?Ôªø
Jason Bateman looks exactly like Xabi Alonso in this movie! wow !!Ôªø
It looks like one of those movies that tell like 3 different stories that 
may or may not intertwine. It seems like they're revolving on internet 
exploitations like stalking, credit fraud, and catfishing??.. idk but 
that's what i got out of it, hope it helps..
$$$$
This trailer nailed it!Ôªø
I love this movie, I went shopping for my birthday and I made sure I got 
this!Ôªø

Oh Lord I'm so much looking forward to see this movie;) 
Out of all princesses, she is the one who doesn't wants to mary or be a 
princess at all.
KELLY MACDONALD IS MERIDA!! another reason why i want to see it

Feast your eyes! <3 that part! ^^
well, go to metacritic. look up pixar. see how every pixar movie EXCEPT 
cars 2 has a very high score?
I know huh...
I was going to ask a red head out to dinner but then took her arrow in the

This has been by far one of the best Horror films of our time, it's 
original in every sense. I cannot get over how amazing this film was and I 
can't wait for part 2.
Horror is my main movie genre and I'm obsessed with movies that make me 
feel uncomfortable at night and this movie made me feel like that and I 
Love the adrenaline rush that I received from this movie.

Great movie, no other words.Ôªø
stop writing comments like "oh my god this movie aint even scary i watched 
it when i was home alone" what are u trying to prove. i bet you were hiding 
under your blanket pissing yourself stfu. . Ôªø
so im a pussy if it comes to horror movies but like this movie was not even 
close to be scary
there was maybe 1 scene where i actually jumped
bad film !Ôªø
It was definitely creepy, particularly the super 8 films of the lawnmower 
and the car I found the most disturbing. The music was probably the 
creepiest soundtrack I've heard too and some parts did make me jump, but I 
didn't think it was amazing, ok for a one-time watch. Ôªø
Creepy. I jumped alot when I watched this movie. It had a good build up of 
suspense and the storyline was good too.Ôªø
Mr. Boogie !!! ha !!Ôªø
Mick Thomson is that you?Ôªø
the fact that people comment and say "i watched this with the lights 
off....bla bla bla.... not scary" show how fucking scared you were. just 
like when 5 year olds go through haunted houses and say "not scary not 
scary". what are you retards trying to prove?Ôªø
My girlfriend got really scared in this movie to the point that she doesn't 
want me to leave just for a sec. LOLÔªø
I watched this movie outside in our backyard, we we're going to spend the 
night sleeping out there and guess what we did after the movie ended? 
Technically, I took a deep breath and said babe, it's time to go back into 
the house. I ain't scared, I just wanted to get my blanket. -.-Ôªø
Ima watch this movie. Looks good init (y)Ôªø
If You enjoy horror movies as much as i do, I recommend You watch this shitÔªø
Hey Mr Oswalt, when you are in your up in your house at night, it might 
help to turn on a light.Ôªø
HOLYFUCK Ôªø
I liked the first 2 but before midnight looks beter...Ôªø
eventhough i had my facepalm moments with this movies, i still fucking got 
scared. I really wanted this to be a realistic mystery horror than a 
supernatural movie.Ôªø
If you are suffering from constipation,  take your laptop. Take a seat in 
the toilet and watch this movie. Constipation problem gone.....Ôªø
Don't lie, you shit yourself. 
Creepy
Can't even bare to watch it full screen
And he probably remained there as well.
There wasn't any real resolving done as you said. I think it was more just 
trying to make the viewers think all the crazy was going on with the son as 
an attempt to 'surprise' you when it turned out to be the daughter, that 
was really the one bit they didn't do too well...
what do you mean? I can't get scared by horror movies, i don't know why 
really but i just don't and i often laugh at them and people who get 
scared. How am i in denial?
Selina quiet down with all that ruckus
SPOILER I think they were trying to make you think the son would be the 
killer in the end. It was smart.

Her eyebrows are amazing! She reminds me of Jennifer Connelly in Labyrinth.
Though this film looks terrible :/Ôªø

NO
I really want to see this more than snow w hite and the huntsman? 
The ending for this movie was so shitty. -.- I hated the ending so much. 
It was a pretty good movie. Really enjoyed it. Couldn't take my eyes off 
Armie Hammer though!!!!
She is soo ugly i mean whats up with her dress at the begining urr
Say helo to my little friend
MIRRORS ON THE WALL , HERE WE ARE AGAIN

I searched "Trailer"  Not the whole movie...Ôªø
Next to L.A. Confidential; one of the best cop movies EVER!Ôªø
This movie is fantastic. But it really made me dislike the mexican 
gangbangers. So fucking cocky. But it was a necessary evil.Ôªø
Amazing movieÔªø
this movie is dopeÔªø
trailer gave way too much awayÔªø
What is the song called?Ôªø
It's Heart touching movie.,,., awesome !!!Ôªø
THIS TRAILER SPOILS THE MOVIE DO NOT WATCH BEFORE WATCHING THE MOVIE!!!!!! 
‚òÖÔªø
gruesome at parts; otherwise, it was a really really good movieÔªø
great movieÔªø
This movie is fucking awesome, I loved every fucking minute <3 and those 
who said fuck that police, all I have to said is fuck you xD I hope one day 
you don't need the help of the police xD Ôªø
The bitch at the end in the apartment was FUCKING ANNOYING!!!

Great movie though.Ôªø
Best movie I watched in 2013Ôªø
I actually really enjoyed this movie, amazing acting. But I just watched 
this trailer for the first time, and its fucked. It's basically a summary 
of the entire movie, I dont know how anybody thinks a trailer should give 
away this much of the plot. I can't stand that shit. Ôªø
this movie made me dislike mexicans even more lol Ôªø
I loved how those PIGS got basted at the end!!!!Ôªø
The worst part about this movie is it makes you feel sorry for PIGS, the 
best part is watching those pigs get fucked up.Ôªø
This movie was okay, but would've been better if there wasn't so much 
swearing! Though the end had me in tears, I won't lie. But I still think 
Training Day was better.
this was an amazing trailer it had me hooked in, and I rarely wanna see a 
movie in theaters anymore,
sigh...okay. say that shit when law enforcement is your only hope one day 
dude.

Lincoln was a liar and warmonger...this movie is a lieÔªø
Great movie!Ôªø
Lincoln restored the Union, you can label him what you want but he united 
this great nation whole again. You can thank him for that.Ôªø
That this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom and that 
government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish 
from the earthÔªø
This is one of my favorite movies. Daniel Day Lewis really did a great job 
playing the role as Lincoln. I could not imagine someone who can play as 
excellent as he did in this epic historical film.Ôªø
My favorite movie of all time so far!Ôªø
@Dom Rice
Yeah, well so was Bush Jr Ôªø
One of the best movies I ever seen. So genuine, so real that It really 
feels that it reflekts reality, perferkt work from King as always!!Ôªø
Apostolate Films gives 'LINCOLN' a three cross rating.  + + +  BE SURE TO 
SEE THIS WONDERFUL, PRO-LIFE FILM that inspires us in our time to 
officially declare that our unborn citizens are human beings whose lives 
are worth defending. "Help that kills (abortion) isn't help at all."  ~

Spielberg & Daniel Day-Lewis? How could this not be a good movie?Ôªø
Daniel Day-Lewis? I'll be there!!!Ôªø

"Shall we stop this bleeding?" - No Sir, not for another 100 years. And 
then we turn to other countries around the world.

What an important movie for our generation...Ôªø
Kind people will never have power for too long, because their vision of a 
better world is always conflicting with the selfish people who rule the 
world. Politics is a dangerous game for those who want to empower the 
people and Spielberg manages to transform Lincoln's last struggles in a 
piece of art which, I dare to say is characteristic to how things are being 
settled in Politics even today.Ôªø

*Lincoln* 

A very interesting movie especially given today's events. Ôªø
One of the finest movies I've seen in the past few moths: Lincoln

It's possible to create an amazing movie without violence and nudity. Who,

I give it a 8/10. This is an important part of the American history, a very 
specific era: how Lincoln managed to get the votes he needs to get an 
amendment to the constitution. As important as it is, it would have been 
boring for the academy if it was telling the same story for any other 
country in the world. So take this as american masturbation over their 
national pride for their own history? America is great, has always been. 
Again, important part yes, but I find the interest in this movie and its 
appreciation greatly exaggerated. It is, however, a better Spielberg movie 
than usual, my expectation were very low after the extremely annoying War 
Horse last year, and he surprised me quite much. Day Lewis absolutely 
deserves another Oscar for that off the charts performance.

Nominated for:
Actor In a Leading Role
Actor In a Supporting Role
Actress In a Supporting Role
Best Picture
Cinematography
Costume Design
Directing
Film Editing
Music (Original Score)

jennifer lawrence's worst movie she's doneÔªø
*HOUSE OF HORROR BLOG PRESENTS: 31 DAYS OF HALLOWEEN HORROR! - DAY 8*

*DAY 8 ‚Äì THE HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET (2012)*

Directed by: Mark Tonderai
Produced by: Aaron Ryder, Peter Block, Ryan Kavanaugh
Written by: David Loucka, Jonathan Mostow
Starring: Jennifer Lawrence, Max Thieriot, Elisabeth Shue
Released: September 21, 2012

This movie is a refreshing change of pace amidst the screenings of 
monsters, maniacs, ghouls, and ghosts that have made up much of the 
viewings thus far. One part mystery, one part thriller, with elements of 
*Psycho*, and *Sleepaway Camp* make up the sinister recipe of *The House At 
The End Of The Street*. The biggest weight of this film, however, lies in 
the ending. Elizabeth Shue, my fantasy girlfriend from the 1980‚Ä≤s, plays 
Sarah Cassidy ‚Äì a recently divorced mother who moves into a home in a new 
community with her teenaged daughter Elissa (played by my new fantasy 
girlfriend Jennifer Lawrence). The ladies are able to afford this gorgeous 
home, because the street has had difficulty with real estate values because 
of the titular neighboring house. Four years prior, a young girl, 
Carrie-Ann Jacobsen brutally murdered her parents...

I am shit scarred of horror movies and this one didn't scare me but great 
film and jennifer lawence well acted as always
Ôªø
A horror movie without blood?Ôªø
Doesn't this story have a twist? Sorry if I spoiled. I'm just confused if 
it's the movie or a different one xÔªø
Wait he is so hot‚Ä¶ Ôªø
Stop joking around katniss, pick up the bow and shoot the bitc**Ôªø
soooo in Abduction Taylor wolf boy said "i watched my parents get killed" 
and i laughed. here Jennifer Lawrence says "Your parents got killed" and 
I'm not laughing. Oscar changes things. and boobs. Ôªø
so interesting and attractive for watchingÔªø
Yes watch this movie it is worth it jlaw makes it good but once u watch it 
it is a really good story line to it toÔªø
this movie is amazing it is totally worth it to watch itÔªø
This movie is so boring it would put even chronic insomniacs straight to 
sleep.fuck.Ôªø
I just bought this flick on blu-ray for $11,is NOT that bad i kinda liked 
the movie..only i bought because of  Max Thieriot,his fucking HOT AS FUCK 
in that flick!Ôªø
My Max is so hot:)Ôªø

this is a perfect example of why i dont like being in ma house...alone in 
the dark!
Wow Katniss with blonde hair
I look forward to watching it. Quick question, what is your opinion on the 
new Silent Hill film trailer? You think it looks any good?
Only if she listened to her fucking mother.

No, like - completely party focused. Those movies are entirely about the 
party(ies) while project X's entire film is founded on the party.
That was horrible try again.
this reminds me of shane dawson videos :P
get drunk they said... it will be fun they said... EVERYTHING WILL BE OK 
THEY SAID!!!
/watch?v=SViZJTizFjo&feature=p¬≠¬≠lcp 
I want a party like this jajajajajajaja XD
THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER
Bachelor party? Risky Business? 
watching this movie was like taking mental poison, i could feel my IQ 
dropping.
Not a huge fan of the movie but I'm liking the soundtrack (;
I love it!
I'm amazed at myself for having been so excited for this piece of shit...
I agree. Even as soon as I heard that it was from the producers of 
Hangover, I knew I was not going to watch it. Just thinking about the 
future is annoying :D
they are making a sequel

Should have used your petronas.Ôªø
DANIELL RADC-

Fuck this im outta hereÔªø
Fantastic film. Daniel Radcliffe does an excellent job.Ôªø
ExpeliamusÔªø
Awesome movie, full on creepy.Ôªø
I went to a friend's party and saw this. The night after I had a nightmare 
NOT about the movie, but about the people at the party. It was a crazy 
party.Ôªø
Absolutely love this movie one of the best horror/thriller movies in years. 
A great story and a great cast. We need more movies like this. Ôªø
This movie looks so good. It has a good actor; good environment; good 
setting(England-I think- small town and it takes place in around 1800, just 
wonderful). And that poem was excellent, so classy.Ôªø
the play of this is abosultey terrifying , gave me more nightmares than the 
movie Ôªø
‚ÄéÔªø
Just finished the movie, outcome: I sharded twice.Ôªø
It's not as scary as it looks.........
Or is it?
Brilliant film: buy and watchÔªø
I want to see this so bad! What is it rated? And is there anything 
inappropriate in it?Ôªø
USE YOUR WAND, HARRY! USE YOUR WAND! c:
This was a good movieÔªø
Harry Potter's an actor?Ôªø
Ive seen the whole movie its epic!:)Ôªø
10 points for gryfondor!Ôªø

place?Ôªø
They changed quite a few moments in the movie compared to this trailer.Ôªø
Just watched it. WAAAY better than MIB2. Man that one blewÔªø

I didn't see wen will Smith was talking 2 the drawing guy on the wallÔªø
Am I the only one who noticed a HUGE hole in the plot? If K was killed in 
1969, he would not have been alive to recruit J. So how does J still have a 
job after K is killed???Ôªø

MIB is coming..dont miss it..Ôªø
$$$$
Watch this movie 2 years ago in theatres in 3D! Good movieÔªø
This movie was really good. And the book is even better. Ôªø
So if i get this right the meaning of the movie is that god is not real but 
we want to think he is?Ôªø
i don't like the indian culture but i'll watch this movie..Ôªø
So it's about a kid that survives something like the Titanic and shares a 
load of moments with the animals.. Not sure if I should give this movie a 
tryÔªø
This book is the most boring piece of shit i've ever had to read in english 
class hahaÔªø
thx for sharing that worldcupfootbalinza Ôªø
One of the best movie I've seen so far.

I'm actually quite surprised to see that so many people don't even realize 
that there's never been a real tiger in the movie in the first place 
(starting from the boat scene). The tiger is merely a depiction of his 
'survival instinct' hence why the tiger left by the end of his journey 
(because he lands to safety in civilized world), the other animals were the 
representation of the other survivors (his mom, the cook, and that guy with 
broken leg). The story was told in animal representation because it'd be 
too much for others to know the "truth" behind what's really happened.Ôªø
Makes you think of how anyone could've survived on flight MH370...The ocean 
is a beautiful yet deadly vast waterbed that most part has never even been 
explored by man.Ôªø
Watched it right after i saw this trailer and didnt regret it ;D awesome 
movieÔªø
when i watched it .. i though it will be boring .. :) but i realize it's a 
good movie .. :) Ôªø
I liked this movie because of it's beautiful cinematography and probably 
the best CGI I've ever seen, but the story was a bit thin, and one sentence 
at the end kinda ruined it for me. "This story will make you believe in 
God", well, that didn't work for me, on the contrary...Ôªø
This movie is a  very incredible story and very touchingÔªø
THIS MOVIE IS GREAT :DÔªø
Life of 3,14:)Ôªø
I love this movie :DÔªø
great movieÔªø
Amazing movie!!Ôªø
This movie really touches my heart. I love the tiger.Ôªø
Very good movie! :)Ôªø
I watched this movie not hearing anything about it and expecting it to be 
terrible, but it ended up being a great movie, I would probably only watch 
it 1 more time thoÔªø
My only thought "WAY TOO MUCH FUCKING CG" not going to watch this movie 
now Ôªø
This movie is SO GREAT!!! There are so many hidden meanings and 
interpretations that can come from this. And yes, this is coming from the 
person who hasn't read the book......YET.Ôªø
dont be rude i want to see it so badlyÔªø
The movie was very good even with indian english :) Ôªø
$$$$
My son made me watch this today - quite enjoyable :o)Ôªø
0:08 what is song name???Ôªø
why isn't the black guy the evil one?Ôªø
*Cronicle* My humble review 

Just finished *Cronicle* a la redbox. If you were a fan of *Akira* you'll 
want to see this. Very entertaining -good story. 

I appreciate the directors vision and efforts to make the use of video 
cameras seem real, as in *Cloverfield* but in this movie we find the fine 
line between keepin-it-real and knock-that-shit-off-already! Seriously, we 
get it, video cameras don't like being jarred around, but it was over done 
to the point of annoyance. 

I also thought the talent show was a bit over the top. All in all I'd give 
it 7 outta 10.

#movies #cronicle #akiraÔªø
This looks good. Filmed very much like "Cloverfield", but with a superhero 
feel.Ôªø
Looks like a good movie.Ôªø
Chronicle - good enough to be a time filler.Ôªø
Merci Schoobie !
;-)Ôªø
This looks good to watch too!! :)Ôªø
Looks interesting, but I don't think I'll get round to watching it.Ôªø
This movie looks very #GOODÔªø
This could be interesting!

Go. See. This. Movie. 

It's the most original film I've seen in a long time. Thoroughly enjoyable, 
thrilling, disturbing, occasionally bizarre and sometimes profound too. I 
did not want it to end. This is what movies should be like.Ôªø
Tonight's movie online.Ôªø
What are you capable ofÔªø
Just saw Chronicle, and was really impressed. So much more than the simple 
hand camera flick I had expected. Goose bumps everywhere. Go see it!Ôªø
Three high school friends gain superpowers after making an incredible 
discovery. Soon, though, they find their lives spinning out of control and 
their bond tested as they embrace their darker sides.

I'm interested.Ôªø
This looks pretty cool : )Ôªø
Just going by this trailer, this could be a interesting take on the whole 
'found footage' movie genre.Ôªø
Trailer for "Chronicle", a found footage superhero movie (i.e. Cloverfield, 
Blair Witch).Ôªø
I'm also looking forward to this! 

Man... to be a movie reviewer and get to see this stuff sooner.Ôªø
A found footage superhero movie. Looks interesting.Ôªø

whats the song in this trailer?! i cant remember its name for the life of me
A lot of people dates more people at the same time, you probably wont know 
cause you use your hand to pleasure yourself
looks nice
Solution. Threesome...Alot of threesome.
Awsome movie !! ;)
Awesome movie :)
Dumb question, but.........anyone know what was the MPAA rating on this 
movie? Just curious.
Loved this movie!!! It was incredible, a must see! 
Greaaaat movie even though I didn't agree with the decision she made
Call me stupid but I think if there was a sequel to this it would be about 
FDR and Lauren having trouble with their marriage and Tuck and Trish try to 
help out with their advice on what to do which at first causes trouble but 
then they see how Tuck worked HIS marriage which his wife and Trish 
managing to stay with HER husband...all this happening while the biggest 
heist is about to happen in Los Angeles. ...Lame, sure, but I would call it 
"This Means Another War" XD hehe...okay...

gz this guy destroyed my favourite Movies !!! ... i want mat daymonÔªø
more like "Gilroy shitting on bourne's legacy"Ôªø
No one can change Matt damon as Jason bourne in this filmÔªø
vagina penis boob faceÔªø
Who only can change Matt in this movie----- Mark WahlbergÔªø
I just learned and heard why Matt Demon is not in this! It's because Matt 
Demon doesn't want to play Jason Bourne anymore, and the Jason Bourne 
character said "don't come looking for me". Because Bourne doesn't want to 
be a assassin anymore which means he wants to be lefted alone as a 
retirement!Ôªø
Is that coincidentally the same actor as Hawkeye from The Avengers?Ôªø
1:11 Of course there was never just one! There was also Leonid Danilovich 
Arkadin!Ôªø
IDK why people hate this movie so much, the worst part was the horribly 
shot and edited chase at the end.Ôªø
Jason Bourne is just the tip of the iceberg, simple as that.. That's why 
there is Aaron Cross. -___-Ôªø
I really don't know why some of the people here love this movie so much. 
Seriously, have you seen the first 3 bourne movies?! Theres not even a 
"real" storyline in this movie. Its pretty much they are running away and 
boom, the movie ends. They shoulda follow the hollywood rules to stop after 
3 sequels. Id rewatch the Bourne trilogy anytime, but not this one.Ôªø
A very decent movie.  Put it this way, had this film come out without any 
of the other previous Bournes having been made, people would be going on 
about how great it is.  On its own, its stands up very well just don't 
compare it to the Matt Damon filmsÔªø
I think Jeremy Renner was awesome playing in this Bourne franchise. I see 
him more fit and more believable in action sequences than Matt Damon. You'd 
have me think Jeremy is a real soldier. No offenses to Matt's fans, he 
should just stick to light action movies or romantic themed films.Ôªø
People need to relax and stop bitching about Matt Damon not playing Bourne. 
The reason he didn't play Bourne is because he said himself he didn't want 
to play Bourne anymore that it would be too hard to come up with another 
story now that nobody is after him. And as For Jeremy Renner Playing Aaron 
Cross I thought it was a good movie. Sure we all agree that he should 
killed the agent with a awesome fight scene but it didn't happen we can 
only hope for way more fight scenes in "The Bourne Legacy Sequel" yeah I 
said it. There is going to be another movie released summer of 2015. Look 
it up and if you're bitching about that too simply do yourself a favor and 
don't watch it. Ôªø
the Bourne series is just awesome, although Matt Damon is not in this 
series, jeremy Renner just nailed it :) good thing they chose him to 
replace damon. :) BTW, over all, The Bourne Legacy is a good movie :)Ôªø
1:25 that fight! With the needle, then him killing him after the house 
destruction! So good. This movke wasn't as good as the first 3 but was dead 
close!Ôªø
VERY NICEÔªø
Sweet Jeremy is the new Bourne, such a bad ass, great actor, not to mention 
Hot Hot Hot, what can I say it's his eyes that attract me to him.Happy 
belated Jeremy...Ôªø
In the real Bourne movies, they said there was only one Bourne, and they 
should have let it been that way... One Bourne, Jason Bourne!Ôªø
best part at the end with the chase through crowded Manila streets, real 
heartstopper!Ôªø
Awesome soundtrack in the trailerÔªø
The Bourne Legacy!Ôªø
Shoot me now.

no appearance of seth rogen??Ôªø
sorry to ask, but, what legacy? 
1:16 german police :D
cos its about the legacy that jason bourne left for the other treadstone 
agents
It takes place within the same universe and takes place around the same 
time as "The Bourne Ultimatum"
Do not write HD if it s not HD! If you re not able to upload hd and just 
want clicks, fuck off!
Isn't the second film set in Russia?
In the end, yes. But a part of the movie is in Berlin.
No shit Sherlock
Why is the new film called 'Bourne Legacy' when bourne insn't in it?

The best movie of the complete Trilogy of The Matt Damon Bourne movies.
After the director quit the Bourne projects - The Main Protagonist (Matt 
Damon) Stopped acting in the series.
Now we have to live with Aaron Cross our next protagonist! No Matt Damon = 
No Bourne. James Bond actors can always be replaced but not Bourne!Ôªø
What's the song used ?Ôªø
just dont worth...this movie totaly sucks,who told to these idiots that 
must move the camera up and down all the fucking time....JUST AWFUL AND 
BORIN MOVIEÔªø
THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM (Paul Greengrass, 2007)

2nd watch. 4/4.

'I remember. I remember everything. I'm no longer Jason Bourne.' 
'So now you're gonna to kill me.'
'No. You don't deserve the star they'd give you on the wall at Langley.'
Jason Bourne and Dr. Albert HirschÔªø
you see this trailer and you know some asses will be kicked by bourne
There is four movies, These ones is about Jason Bourne: The Bourne 
Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum. Then there is the 
fourth: The Bourne Legacy which rarely mentions Jason but its about someone 
as Jason, he is called Aeron Cross. The movie is okay i guess but i like 
1-3 better.
BEST SCENE EVER ! Noah Vosen: Perhaps we can arrange a meet. Jason Bourne: 
Where are you now? Noah Vosen: I'm sitting in my office. Jason Bourne: I 
doubt that. Noah Vosen: Why would you doubt that? Jason Bourne: If you were 
in your office right now we'd be having this conversation face-to-face. 
[Bourne hangs up] OH SHIIIT !
jason bourne would shit all over james bond
how many parts exist?
what is the song at 1:36?
Is 415 East 71 Street haunted ? Is it much like Ghostbuster.
1 of the legendary movies!,actually u haven't heard about the true action 
yet though it's kinda old movie ,but i wish that i haven't seen it be4 :D
i just found out that David Strathairn's brother is my english teacher at 
san marcos high school awesome
Ohhh yeahhh... The Legacy was a disgrace to the trilogy!!!!
bourne legacy is shit. these first three are some of the best films in the 
world
These Bourne Movies are, awesome, Its like he is actually planning every 
move but u still think he isnt...So much action, so much Awesomeness
movies dont get any better than this
THIS BORNE ULTIMATUM IS THE BEST !!!!

I read the reviews and listened to people who said this movie, Total Recall 
(2012), was not so good. I decided not to bother seeing it because of that 
information. 

*Dead Wrong.*

I loved it! If you expect it to be a remake of Total Recall with Arnold 
Schwarzenegger then you'll be disappointed. It is its own movie, totally 
different, and kept my interest from beginning to end. It's not some 
cinematic masterpiece but damn if it isn't good watching. Ôªø
This is a prime example of shitty remakes reboots whatever you want to call 
it. This movie sucked from the first second, a complete utter waste of time 
and pointless garbage.Ôªø
I watched the original one today. I think it was better than this.Ôªø
None
total recall is a bad copy of original Total Recall .... even the woman 
with 3 boobs is on this movie... common` this is totally a lack of 
imaginationÔªø
Totally disappointed!!!What i learned from this movie is that excess CGI 
makes it look like crap.Arnie's Total Recall is 1000000000000000000000000 
better than this.Ôªø
very bladerunner...Ôªø
Two weeks.Ôªø
New TotalRecall trailer...  as usual, the UK are made to wait on the 
release. 3rd August US, 29th August UK!? #GoFigureÔªø
i am so torn about this...i want to like it but all i see in my head is 
arnold pulling a blinking red ball out of his nose and a chick with 3 
tits....

TOTAL RECALL - Official Trailer - In Theaters August 3rdÔªø
WOW! This looks awesome! But, what is with the Storm Trooper clones? (pun 
intended)Ôªø
Total Recall has released a brand new trailer showing us much more of what 
to expect from the upcoming remake directed by Underworld and Live Free or 
Die Hard director, Len Wiseman.Ôªø
First time I've stopped a trailer before the end... what a load of crap. 
Most unnecessary remake ever?
Certainly won't be seeing this!Ôªø
TOTAL RECALL - Official TrailerÔªø
None
Blade runner, 5th element, Minority Report, I robot... just the kind of 
Sci-fi movie I like! Ôªø
*TOTAL RECALL (Imax)*
Girl with the three tittays. Check. Otherwise, this is all just bad 
story-telling. The first movie was iconic. This one, it's just_ it just 
wants to ride the coattails of the original.
Nope, we don't want to mess with people's heads. Let's all tell them that 
Beckinsale is an antagonist. At the beginning. Yep, the audience, all of 
them are idiots. Let's not mind- eff them like we are Farrell.
Bad script. Bad editing. Bad plot.

Then again, it's got Becks. So if you're a guy, watch. And bring beer. If 
you can.Ôªø
I have to say that I was quite skeptical about this movie when it was 
announced. I mean, come on, the original is a great movie, and was an 
important ingredient that constantly fueled my imagination as an adolescent 
but, after seeing this newest trailer, I am very confident that this new 
version will be kick-ass. http://youtu.be/pPAy56Otr-EÔªø
+1 if you‚Äôre planning to see Total Recall August 3!

Check out the newest trailer below:Ôªø
BREAKING: Total Recall trailer. You can never replace the original of 
course, but I'm suprised to say this looks quite good.Ôªø
Ok, maybe.Ôªø
I remember the original and now i'm seeing the remake as well. Anybody who 
dares say that Schwarzenegger is a better actor than Farrell, deserves to 
take a hike on Mars.  Ôªø

How about making a movie about American cowardice? Eliminating entire 
villages with drones for example or attacking vietnamese villages with 
weapons that were declared illegal by the geneva convention.Ôªø
Best modafacking war movieÔªø
+MrNatamana HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! You are hilarious.Ôªø
Nah I'm pretty sure that navy seals are the best special forces team but it 
doesn't really matter nones the best military really we all have are 
military hero it doesn't matter who's is best it matters who's is your 
country'sÔªø
another stupid american movie..blaming other countries to be terrorists? 
fuck youÔªø
Ôªø
Act of Valor + Medal of Honor :D
/watch?v=oT7s9JWXcPMÔªø
Russians surely don't have best military they became weak after the 
separation of the Soviet Union and Russia it self after 1960 and is a 
pretty low tech militaryÔªø
Ok, I usually avoid these type of moronic comments, but REALLY? the US or 
Russia? I think you are forgetting something with your little few century 
old country... England MADE the USA. England had one of the largest empires 
there was. England has been involved in every major conflict in a large 
role (Including Vietnam, look it up. our SF units signed up to help the 
US.) and you cocky cunts have the nerve to imply YOU are the Justicar's of 
the world? bitch we MADE you. 
Great film, I watch it almost every week 
Heroes my ass. They excel at killing civilians though I'll give them that. 
Not most of them though, thank God.
Hey kid whats your problem with the US military? Some times I just wish we 
would just pull out and just isolate ourselves from the rest of the world 
just like it used to be in the late 1800s. Then I would love to see how you 
guys act. You Eurofags probably would be on your knees again asking for us 
to save you just like every damn major conflict that happens.
Aah, another Dept. of Defense sponsored crap propaganda movie, This time 
even two real SEALs play in it. If this doesn't get the American Rednecks 
going then I don't know what else will. MURICA!
u can't always assure ur safety in the field :|
i laughed my ass off at 0:40 when the song went "GAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH" and 
took a giant breath when the guys popped up out of the water XD
Nice Propaganada Hollywood !!! 
You truly bring life to the "dumb americans" as the rest of the world sees 
you :)
...great movie...
Fuck Call of Duty, Battlefield is the real shit !
Medal of Honor Warfighter.....
Well of course we cant be everywhere at once. We might be the best but we 
are not god.

1:44 Now that's Usain BoltÔªø
This movie is so racist and so wrong in every way, but I can't deny i 
laughed so hard while watching it.Ôªø

Going to the Advanced screening of Here Comes the Boom tonight starring 
Kevin James.Ôªø
A couple nights ago Cathy & I rented "Here Comes the Boom" online and were 
pleasantly surprised at it being a mainstream entertainment movie yet 
actually being pretty morally appropriate.  I've become accustomed to 
sacrificing my moral standards pretty significantly in at least one 
category if I want to watch a popular action or comedy, but that was not 
required for this one!

Here's a brief review of it that describes my point:  
http://www.catholicnews.com/data/movies/12mv122.htmÔªø
Muhaha: "Das Schwergewicht", original besser *Here comes the boom*. In D ab 
8.11.2012Ôªø
might watch.Ôªø
Excellent movie.Ôªø
*Here Comes the Boom In Theaters October 12*

In the comedy Here Comes the Boom, former collegiate wrestler Scott Voss 
(Kevin James) is a 42-year-old apathetic biology teacher in a failing high 
school. When cutbacks threaten to cancel the music program and lay off its 
teacher (Henry Winkler,) Scott begins to raise money by moonlighting as a 
mixed martial arts fighter. Everyone thinks Scott is crazy - most of all 
the school nurse, Bella (Salma Hayek) - but in his quest, Scott gains 
something he never expected as he becomes a sensation that rallies the 
entire school. #ufc  Ôªø
I've heard great things about this movie.  I can't wait to see it.Ôªø

The candles flickered dimly, unveiling a slight visibility in front of him. 
He stepped cautiously along the carved stone corridor. It was damp and 
dreary. He found his chambers after a while when he was blocked by a 
splintery wooden door, with metal spikes dug into the center and a copper 
trimming around the edges. He clasped the round handle and pulled it. The 
door creaked as it slowly crept, giving way to enter the room. The room had 
a perfumed scent, it filled his nose and widened his eyes. The carpets were 
purple and glowing softly; reflecting the bright candle light. The bed was 
big enough for four and the pink silk draperies towering the bed. Looking 
through the silks, he saw the faint silhouette of a woman.

The mystery woman looked slender and full of shape. He approached the bed 
and pulled the cover that blocked his view. She sleeps like a kitten. Her 
breasts touched the bed. Her pink nipples were hard. Her bottom covered by 
a soft-silver silk sheet. He eased his hands slowly and rubbed her bare 
legs. She awoke and quivered slightly at his touch. Her glossy curled black 
hair fell at her breasts. She looked at him, her face was blushing, her 
lips were full and red. Her eyes were green and daring. She smiled a faint 
smile and reached for his hand. She pulled and placed it between her legs. 
She‚Äôs wet. He elegantly caressed her; causing her to gasp. His other hand 
reached for her breast which he touched and rubbed. when she seemed to like 
that he moved onto slowly pinching her hard nipple; that made her moan. She 
bit her lip and clutched his shirt; she ripped it apart, with tattered bits 
flying all over. In a matter of seconds, he entered her slowly. She placed 
her hands on his sweating bare chest.  She looked at his  hazel eyes, as he 
looked at hers. He felt a queazy feeling and spread his seed around her 
pale thighs. She collected the sperm with her finger and licked it slowly. 
She swallowed as she smiled her wicked smile at him. ‚ÄúDid you like me?‚Äù she 
said with a honeyed voice, as sweet as an angle‚Äôs song. He looked at her, 
wore his breeches and whispered ‚ÄúNo‚Äù.

‚ÄúDid you like me?‚Äù she said with a honeyed voice, as sweet as an angle‚Äôs 
song. He looked at her, wore his breeches and whispered 
‚ÄúNo‚Äù.
She pouted and replied defensively ‚ÄúWhy not? who are you anyways?‚Äù
‚ÄúMe? well I am Dickman, Richard Phillip Dickman‚Äù he said as he cloaked 
himself with his woolen hood. he began to wear his clothes again. He 
glanced at her once more, her pale smooth naked skin against that soft 
mattress, well he was tempted to take her again. And he did. By the time he 
had finished the second time, she was sweating as well as him, the image of 
her bouncing teats had nuzzled their way into his mind and set snuggly in 
his memories. 
‚ÄúWhy Dickman‚Äù she asked.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of... well how can I explain this?‚Äù he dropped his hood and 
unzipped his head, out of it came bouncing a huge penis, jiggling its way 
to the ground with a pool of blood around it. He heard a scream, and 
nothing else.He woke up to find her dead, her vagina loosened to such 
extremes that he would have never thought it possible; whatever penetrated 
her had surely destroyed her vagina and her stomach with it, and it left 
her dead.Ôªø
So what type of books should I read to stimulate my brain. I don't think 
any type of book will do. Because if it is then I will start reading my 
favorite type of stories. Alien invasions. Should i just really read about 
my favorite topics? Please let me know. Ôªø
Just a moment ago, I finished watching the film. Director¬¥s work isn¬¥t as 
original as you¬¥d expect (a good example of several lifetimes in one story 
could be The Hours), but I really enjoyed the acting and the suspense it 
was able to create.
Also, I really liked the ending. STOP READING if you haven¬¥t seen it! When 
Daniela asks ¬®what do you really want?¬®, we are being brought back to the 
beautiful intimate scene where he apologizes to his wife. That final ¬®I¬¥m 
sorry¬® tells you all he really wants (and needs) is the relief of 
forgiveness.Ôªø
0:59 OMG his face  lolÔªø
great film, horrible trailer...Ôªø
I don't really like or even watch these kind of movies but this one makes a 
huge exception.    9/10 great movieÔªø
it's interesting when Yahoo had said that this film only made ¬£707 in UK 
box office...because I really liked the concept of the film... is it just 
me who had thought that  it seemed good?Ôªø
amazing <3 i like itÔªø
currently obsessed with Demons song. and then I found this trailer and I 
literally screaming inside. And the plot looks so interesting! ben barnes 
and bradley cooper and zoey saldana. This is gonna be good!!!! Ôªø
wait, i didn't really get the ending. could anyone who's seen it just 
explain what happens? P.S sorry for being such a naive fool :PÔªø
And YES, Bradley Cooper is a writer again and he faces problems with his 
writing, but this time, the secret of his later success is not 
"medication", but an old book he found....Well, i therefore have to say 
that it looks so original!! But i'm gonna watch this movie anyway, 'cause i 
kind of liked the storyline.Ôªø
THE WORDS BEN BARNES


The Words - Official Trailer (2012) [HD] Bradley CooperÔªø
It speaks volumes about our society that this film has a 22% rating on 
RottenTomatoes and was generally panned by the critics.  Were there not 
enough cuss words?  not enough explosions?  Was it too tough for peoples 
mind to comprehend?    This was a great film with a great plot and a great 
story.  My favorite movie of 2012. Ôªø
Officially one of the BEST movies of all time on my list. 10/10. Hesitated 
at first but I'm so glad I watched it. Worth every minute. Story line is 
great. Acting is superb. Heck the all-star cast is just a bonus. Why is 
this movie not so popular? Why the poor ratings from the so-called movie 
critics? Is it because there are no explosions? No CGI effects? No aliens 
nor superheroes? No guns, drugs, sex or violence? I really wonder why. 
Guys, do yourselves a favor. Dont listen to Rotten Tomatoes and those other 
bullcraps. I'm really starting to doubt their reliability. Just go watch 
the movie! Just my 2 cents.Ôªø
