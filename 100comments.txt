We know he turns into Spiderman. It's okay to reveal that in the trailer.﻿
aaa man ive watched this movie like 8 times already cant wait 14 days to 
watch the new one!!!!!﻿
I remembered when I first watched this trailer and couldn't get a good look 
at the costume. I got so mad. Lolcats. ﻿
I preferred this movie to the ones Sam Raimi did, the older ones where good 
but i dont think they stood the test of time.  With the new darker grittier 
type of superhero movies out the others look dated.  But i could be biased 
seeing as i dont like Raimi ﻿
Great movie.﻿
I prefer the old version not this one, it dosent have a story line to it,﻿
love this movie!﻿
name of the intro background music after wen he looked into the window as a 
kid?﻿
Just going to put my comment that a type in the new amazing spider man 
movie Wow just when i start to like the outfit he wear in the first 
movie!!! he just need to wear a belt like in the game so its not so focus 
in his dick! anyway the outfit his wearing today look like from the 
ultimate spiderman game other words it looks cartoon looking and not very 
realistic! like the first movie! all they need to do is make the outfit in 
the first movie wears a belt and his eyes should be glass yellow then black 
sunglasses that they use just so its more realistic of a teenager made it 
himself. also rhino looks like a robot that is a power ranger enemies and 
green goblin look like a robot as well but human type of way also looks 
almost the same as the new goblin in spiderman 3! like really!!! the only 
bad ass enemie they made here perfect is electro that look pretty dark and 
bad ass in the same time! just like in the ultimate spiderman game. And 
just the special effects it looks pretty low as shit and the guy shooting 
spidey is so fake looking like the matrix cgi back then. They fuck up a lot 
of things right now in this movie.﻿
I'm so god damn pissed on how they changed the suit on the 2nd movie.. They 
tried making it like the comic/cartoon but it looks like complete garbage 
and it looks like they implemented a cartoon in the movie... I know that 
they don't actually do the stuff in the movie and it's all animation but it 
just looks so stupid on how fast they rushed it﻿
MAX DILAN IS THE ELECTRIC GUY﻿
music?﻿
I think the old ones are better. I miss Tobey McGuire as Peter 
Parker/Spiderman. Plus the old ones seemed to have a better, more in depth 
story line. The actors were better and in my opinion, better looking.﻿
Come now daddy, spidey doesn't want to talk to us right now, he's just too 
polite to say so.﻿
this ain't the real spiderman...just a stupid copy ﻿
woah! this trailer was released almost a year before it came out﻿
Soundtrack at 0:35!!!???﻿
i liked the movie one thing i didn't like was at 1:43 to 2:07 i would give 
this movie 8 or 9 or 9.5. Its the director first big movie i think. the 
movie was awesome﻿
Can spiders climb up on glass ?﻿
cant wait to see this movie﻿
Wow its been two years?﻿
So I haven't been in high school for a few years, but what I take away from 
this is that now you can be tall, dark, and handsome with a decent fashion 
sense, athletisism, high intelligence, have funny and charasmatic 
personality, while having enough backbone to stand up to bullies...and 
STILL be considered a high school outcast who's so socially inept you don't 
have any friends???
Either high school has changed, or this is some bull shit writting and 
miscasting. ﻿
 
Tobey Maguire was a better spiderman overall﻿
he's sexy..you know , like for a half-spider lol﻿
i love this movie﻿

The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey - Official Trailer﻿
Good ol middle earth, so mysterious and grand and majestic﻿
Going to watch this shiet﻿
film nulllllllllllll﻿
awesome﻿
I'll never get over the fact that I STILL haven't seen this movie. Looks 
pretty interesting so far though.﻿
I cried while watching this movie it's so beautiful﻿
i remember last year watching this trailer and at 2:14 i fell out of the 
chair screaming............GGGGGOOOOOOOOOLLLLLLLUUUUUUUMMMMMMMMM!!!!﻿
1:31 from desolation of Smaug﻿
Also im avalibeal for smex just pay me 22222 dousand boobybucks﻿
It's interesting how many clips in this trailer weren't actually in the 
final movie. :o﻿
0:34, 1:32 and 2:07 were from the desolation of smaug.﻿
This trailer makes me wish the movie was like this in a style of the 
fellowship of the ring...﻿
Good, good memories...﻿
The Hobbit Censored version on my channel! (It becomes quite funny when you 
censor it ;D)﻿
This movie changed me as a person, the best trilogy ever.Shore would never 
make a better movie than this, really really top tops!! :)﻿
in :1.48. you sees a part from The hobbit the desolation of smaug, Thats 
wierd!^^﻿
There are Desolation of Smaug scenes in this. I find that funny xD﻿
Who is Gandalf fighting at 1:53 cause that wasnt in an unexpected journey 
or the desolation of smaug, so does that mean that it's in there and back 
again after he gets saved by *______* ****SPOILER BLOCK OUT**** for people 
who don't need to get the next movie accidently spoiled﻿
martin is the best for bilbo﻿
I can't say that the desolation of smaug is better than the unexpected 
journey I really love both of them﻿
Who's the guy at 1:53 that's fighting Gandalf???﻿
did anyone else notice that the shots at 1:13 - 1:16 and 1:31 - 1:32 are 
actually from DoS? ﻿
Noticed that some of the scenes is from Desolation of Smaug﻿
Some of the scenes are from The Desolation of Smaug...﻿

i love this and kristen stewart is with emma watson,jennifer lawrence  the 
best actress ♥﻿
Kristen is sexy and best actress﻿
Such an amazing trailer...such a disappointment trailer!﻿
 The trailer  was great, but the movie was bad, especially in the end when 
snow white was turned into a knight. And the drunken mirror on the wall. I 
mean The queen was so much more beautiful than snow white. Kristen is nice 
but she has just one expression. The only good thing in this movie was 
Charlize Theron. Amazing woman and gorgeous actres.﻿
Seriously?? Kristen Steward as Snowwhite? They seem to have forgotten that 
SnowWhite is the fairest of them all. That means you find an actrice who's 
at least able to close her mouth. Or able to smile﻿
If you havent watched this movie and plan to, just skip to the credit part. 
Its the best trust me.﻿
I don't understand why people complain, it's still one of the best movies I 
have ever watched.﻿
i havent see movie yet i agree that they may pick somebody else maybe that 
girl that play i other version of snow white she was so beatiful so 
innosent but that be strange i think they pick kris because of twiligth 
suces they want fans to pay attension and they pick her annostly in the 
movie kristen is way move cute than twiligth and abouth that with the story 
maybe than for some people wh know the fairy tale is bullshit but i find it 
intresting to make somethink new of ours fav fairy tale s yes maybe those 
movie arent perfevt and have somethink that havent done quet rigth but its 
not that bad that some of the people say﻿
this is the first movie made on Snow White story where is Evil Queen more 
pretty than Snow White,no offence for Kristen but that's what I tkink
And Lily Colins would be much better ﻿
Would have been better if anyone other than Kristen Stewart was playing 
Snow White.﻿
a singer Inna has a song "wow", in her video Inna plays snow white.﻿
This movie is so underrated. A fantastic and breathtaking performance given 
by Charlize Theron as well as Kristen Stewart. The cinematography and 
graphic effects were incredible, and I loved the unique storyline. Such a 
good film.﻿
Wow charlize﻿
I always watch this never get tired of it <3﻿
"Kristen is the best actress" 
I am sorry but she plays always the same. She's good but I personally 
dislike her. She looks like she's always dying and she's always kinda out 
of life. They should have chosen someone else as Snow White... Someone 
brighter! ﻿
I don't see why Charlize Theron character feels threatened by kristen 
Stewarts, Charlize is way more beautiful ﻿
Oh no I felt so sad for the queen :( and please tell me there's going to be 
a sequel! It can't end like that! She has to marry someone! (The Huntsman!)﻿
i didn't see this in theaters but i've seen it on tv and it wasn't that 
bad, the things i disliked most about the film were the queen's creepy 
brother and the fairies in the forest﻿
What can I say about this movie...
The camera work was epic... The fairy forest with the white deer was 
perfect and epic. The magic of the evil queen was epic. 
Charlize Theron did a perfect job I loved her evil queen and
Chris Hemsworth did also a great job! Music was great to and I loved the 
fact that the movie gave you an LotR feeling.
But the story itself was overhasty and missed some dept. Some unimportant 
scene's was giving to much time and it would be nice if they had giving 
some other parts of the movie more dept.  

I don't want to talk about Kristen Stewart. 
I don't know is she is a good actress or not because I haven't see an other 
movie (except twilight 1, which I hated and because of this didn't watched 
the other parts) with her. But she failed as Snow White. I just couldn't 
buy it. Maybe it was because of her character of because of the actress. ﻿
Who love Snow White ? watch this trailer of me!!!﻿
OMG !! Kristen Stewart﻿
OMG... she smiled...
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kristen_Stewart_2,_2012.jpg﻿
what?
Did she just forget to say She's White as Snow...
one word.....Twilight
$$$$
He dies?
just for Joel Edgerton!! <3 
What is the name of the song in the trailer?
I saw this movie about a week ago. it is filled with heartwarming scenes 
and sometimes make you cry scenes. I absolutly love this movie and im sure 
most people will to. i cant wait for it to come out on DVD! 
all movies are from a book 
I saw this one recently. I see your point. I felt a bit sad for Timothy, 
but at least the movie ended on an optimistic note.
Its called adoption
The powers that be are trying to prepair or trick the world into excepting 
hybrid childeren. My 12 year old even noticed the same plot in the movie " 
Mars Needs Moms". There creating hybrid kids just like they make hybrid 
foods
how much you wanna bet the kid will disappear at the end an no one except 
the parents will remember him or something like that.
I've already watched this movie today. It's good and I think you won't be 
disappointed;)
Yeah...he dies....made me cry like a baby.
Sounds like a decent premise, just don't like how the kid comes from the 
fucking garden. Could have just been some orphan
Disney will always help us keep our inner child alive :')
I want to see this movie!!!!!
Anything is possible
i agree with everyone! I just watched the movie! 
Dont watch this with kids they will be tramatized
Because 2 minutes and 32 seconds of a 90+ minute movie sums up the whole 
thing right?
Omg. 3 this is the magic of disney.
I basicly just watched the entire movie, but still im gonna watch it!
About half way through I realised that it was Joel Edgerton, and thought 
"Okay, I'll probably see this now"
Gee, I wonder how this will all play out.
Here's the twist.... He diez...
It's seems like a good movie... but then... He's a tree.
Great trailer. Now I don't have to watch the movie. /sarcasm
$$$$
will next twilight coming out?﻿
Oh great, not another one.﻿
I remember when vampires were actually scary.  ﻿
Better love story than... oh.﻿
F*ck it,i already said that bella should be with Jacob forever,i mean

of "the twilight saga"......i miss it so much....:(﻿
I love this, and I love The Turkey Song by Dickie Stickhead:)﻿
None
Kerreeeennnn...﻿
“Breaking Dawn’s plot points — and there are only four in total — are 
separated by long montages and music-video sequences. The padding is at its 
most brutally obvious when we’re treated to a long sequence, covered by 
three separate cameras, of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) walking up a staircase, 
turning at the landing, walking up another staircase, turning at the 
landing, and walking up a third and final staircase. Yet whole characters 
and subplots are shoved to the side, never to be seen again; I’m almost 
certain that one vampire played by Jackson Rathbone utters but a single 
word. (‘Possibly.’) Breaking Dawn is both overlong and understuffed. I 
lived a thousand lifetimes watching it, and died a thousand deaths. (The 
worst one was when Edward looked up ‘immortalicum’ on Yahoo! search. On 
Yahoo! Search!)”﻿
$$$$
I thought, that, this was the dumbest movie idea of all time.
Then after putting my "THEY LIVE" glasses on. I GET IT!!!
The Vampires are the CENTRAL BANKERS, enemies of FREEDOM, whom President 
Lincoln were at war with back in the 1800's. 
"Green Backs" were Abraham Lincoln's weapons of choice back then.
After five years of battle the Vampires did a "JFK" on The Mighty Hunter.

- 2014 the Vampires have a new weapon against the people PRESIDENT LINCOLN 
tried to save. The weapon's name is: OBAMACARE...

﻿
JFK zombie hunter﻿
This is just the worst piece of crap I've ever seen.﻿
This movie was surprisingly good.﻿
The movie sucks.﻿
Abraham Lincoln reptilian hunter
﻿
I just finished and I absolutely LOVED it. Much better than I was 
expecting.﻿
Thomas Jefferson The Exorcist.﻿
Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter" -  should have been Abraham Lincoln 
Bankster Hunter" ﻿
the movie was actually good , completely unlike i expected﻿
The moive was THE MOST BADASS MOIVE i have ever seen in my entire life... 
no joke﻿
I never thought an axe would be so badass. I mean, look how he handle that 
axe like person using a sword and fluidly flow with the motion. ﻿
I just finished the book and it was amazing. Then I see all these reviews 
for the movie they are all mostly negative. Idk if I should still watch it 
or not, the book was phenomenal!﻿
If you liked blade underworld I Frankenstein stuff like that you will like 
this movie ﻿
teddy wasnt alive in 1945. JFK Nazi Zombie Hunter would make more sense﻿
Best trailer ever﻿
how on earth does abraham lincoln became a vampire hunter . wtf.
I hate it when non fiction became fiction...
﻿
How about this:  Theodore Roosevelt, Werewolf Slayer
Time:  1904   Location:  The jungles of Panama
Synopsis:  a mysterious animal is killing workers who are building the 
Panama Canal.  U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt determines to track it down 
and kill it.  With a small group of companions, he stalks the creature 
through the dark and forbidding jungles of Panama.  As the danger 
increases, TR and his companions begin to wonder:  are they the Hunters, or 
the Hunted?

In real life, Roosevelt was an expert big game hunter who had hunted all 
over the world.

It could also tie-in to a mysterious incident in Roosevelt's life that 
actually happened.  In the years prior to his becoming president, during a 
hunting expedition in Brazil, most of his companions one-by-one 
mysteriously died and TR himself barely survived.
 ﻿
I had high hopes for this movie.They just couldn't pull it off.﻿
So that you Americans make a movie like this: "Barack Obama Over debt 
hunter" LOL LOL LOL﻿
William Syndrome!﻿
Im in sixth grade now but i remember that in 4th grade my classmates 
thought this was true i didnt.﻿

Stop saying the Movie is shit!!!!! This is a sequel to journey to the

I love harry potter and i miss the movies just finshed reading the books i 
love harry potter i couldnt stop crying when i found this was the end :(﻿
I remember saying " HARRY POTTER IS STUPID AND BORING" Now that I have read 
the books I understanded why people love it so much. I shut my mouth 
Quickly.﻿
Surprized by the amount of negative comments of late! If you dont like the 
movie then thats fine, but its such a emotional and powerful finale for the 
series. All the movies rocked...so shut up you book purists....I love the 
books and the series is incredible.﻿
love harry potter? check out and sub to my channel. i've started uploading 
short harry potter videos today and will keep doing so. I will aim for 
about 20 harry potter uploads each week as I have a lot of spare time on my 
hands. much appreciated.﻿

any suggestions as to what scenes you want me to upload, shoot me an inbox 
and i will see what i can do !﻿
I see that 771 Death Eaters have youtube accounts ﻿
This is by far the best Deathly Hallows trailer! And now I'm getting the 
urge to re-read the books...﻿
my favourte part of the movies are Voldemort yell﻿
So sad this was the last movie....﻿
Movies are a superior medium to books because while books can offer more 
detail movies can actually show you what happened. With books a book can 
only tell you what happened but with a movie you get to actually see it. 
Isn't it far more awesome to see a flying car or a Hungarian Horntail that 
just be told about them? Of course and that's why movies are superior to 
books as a medium.﻿
Most people will probably hate me for this but after reading all of them 
this movie sicked compared to the book...﻿
My good! How do I describe what I felt while I watched the movie? I think 
Ive never got the chills as many times as while I was wathcing it. To many 
epcicness. We got Harry confronting Snape, every line uttered by 
Mcgonagall, Neville Killing Nagini, hte battle... Godness gracius: 
DEMENTORS, SPIDERS, GIGANTS, MOLLY WEASLEY KILLING THE B***H... I got no 
words.﻿
I think I seen this movie twice. ﻿
Voldemort : You won't hold my love to you bellatrix, you'll hold two things 
instead.. my heir and this secret until the last moments of your life. .﻿
whens harry potter and the deathly hallows part 3 coming out? it's been 
ages since this came out and I heard theres supposed to be seven movies.﻿
there are still 771 death eaters in the world﻿
"Like" if you like me, find that the begining of this trailer is a little 
sad and give chills with the music from 00:0 at 0:18 :(﻿
Voldemort said geaaar the same 5 times﻿
voldemort's screams made me laugh :DDD﻿
goodbye to an era﻿
Can't believe it's been two years...will there ever be any good saga as 
potters..﻿
there is not gonna be a part 3 part 2 is the last one if there was a part 3 
that would be stupid﻿
MAN I WISH MY MOM WASENT A BITCH AND LET ME READ AND WATCH THE MOVIES LIKE 
THE NORMAL FUCKING GENERATION DID.... GOD DAMMIT!!!!!!!!!!!!! IT WAS RUINED

/Who would cheat on Rachel Mcadams!!!﻿

when she is Marion Cotillard﻿
only i see gad Elmaleh lol﻿
woooooooooooooooooooooooow﻿
It sucked﻿
Very enjoyable - at least to me, it is. Would freak the bejesus out of me 
(more than it did the main character) if I could travel back in a literate 
and beauty-filled past, but would at the same time love my stay there. ﻿
I can watch this movie and give me some reminder about life. Is that right?﻿
Great movie!﻿
Haha "The Detective Agency says the detective is missing." :""D﻿
Quote "this generation is empty and has no imagination" at the of Gill with 
Adriana sitting at Pablo table. This is so what this generation is right 
now. Great movie.﻿
Who would cheat on Rachel Mcadams!!!﻿
such a BOOOOORING film...i didn't watch the trailer bc of Tom but lol way 
too boring....n what a stupid uninspired end﻿
anyone knows what's the song after 1:12 ??﻿
On my top 10 all time list, amazing.﻿
This movie is pure poetry, it makes me wonder, dream and lust for art, 
Paris, lost times, freedom and joy. ﻿
Woody Allen ripped the premise off this movie off from the book Vaporetto 
13. Now that book freaked me out. None the less it was a good movie. ﻿
I started watching this movie because of Huddlestone but GOG, the whole 
cast is amazing!﻿
I <3 Woody Allen movies! He's a genius!
Great vibe, great feelings, great story lines, great actors, great 
presentation of environment (feels like you're there, Barcelona, Paris, 
everywhere) and definitely great non-conventional but NATURAL approach of 
society﻿
I was blown away by this movie...such an unusual storyline, a beautiful 
soundtrack....and Paris! What more could you ask for! :-)﻿
I watched it today and I loved it! It´s amazing!﻿
funny...LIKED! One of his best...bravo Mr. Allen. This lighting designer 
should be knighted...﻿
﻿
I think Woody Allen is the greatest American screenwriter and director of 
this age - That if you can call him a director… he admittedly does nothing 
but let the actors free to do their work, which is probably his greatest 
quality. He takes  takes Paris and bathes it within its own glory all the 
while making one of his most entertaining films in decades. Great 
cinematography, classic music, french food, french culture and Allen's 
trademark humor are pure magic. You may see some of the familiar character 
types from other films, but they only add to the mixture. Yes, it's another 
film from Woody Allen, but this time is not as routinary as You Will Meet A 
Tall Dark Stranger or as cheeky as Vicky Cristina Barcelona. This shows 
Woody Allen at the standard he should be. Original, funny, engaging and 
with some light meaningful message that we all relate to. The colors and 
cinematography of the film are more of the same of the post-Barcelona 
Allen, all beige and brownish, but he achieves a beauty in his portrayal of 
Paris that has not come from him since he first visited London with Match 
Point in 2005. It's also the most original screenplay he has written since, 
and the plot works and looks like one of his short stories, as a crazy, 
illogic and absurd showcase of gags and jokes. For everyone who sometimes 
ponders how life would be in another time, this film through whimsical 
storytelling and pure fantasy transports us. Perhaps that elusive world 
does not really exist or we are never truly content in whatever station we 
reside. Must watch﻿
Today I confirmed why I like Woody Allen's movies so much. I saw "Midnight 
in Paris" and it was delightful. An apparent simple story but filled with 
witty remarks and reflections on how easily we can get hooked on nostalgia 
and being deceived by this illusion of a better past. A truly enjoyable 
movie.﻿
Finally saw *Midnight In Paris* this weekend, and it was even more 
delightful and One of Woody Allen's Best Evar than I'd heard. A movie in 
which it's impossible to pick among the several greatest performances - 
Corey Stoll doing Young Hemingway as a Hemingwaybot is a constant stitch, 
in particular.

Also good: Michael Sheen plays the Allen-staple hateful alpha male to 
Wilson's Protestant Woody Allen and almost outdoes Alan Alda's turn in that 
part. Allison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald, there shoulda been way more of. 
Only Kathy Bates falls flat in the playing famous people department: her 
Gertrude Stein is...Kathy Bates. 

Many things will be familiar to anybody who's read Allen's older comic 
prose pieces about the Lost Generation and other lost generations, but all 
of it is new. The theme, of all eras looking to previous eras as golden 
ages, is both haunting and screamingly funny, a nice meeting of multiple 
aspects of Allen's career.

#Thor is back! The trailer for Marvel's #ThorDarkWorld is LIVE, exclusively 
from YouTube’s #GeekWeek! bit.ly/1750vdU Check it out now!﻿
The ending saved the movie﻿
why they show eather (in tradition was the spirit of 5 elements) as bad 
thing? thats really suspicius..﻿
I just realized that Malekith's voice was different in this than the movie﻿
Totally ruins nordic mythologi.﻿
Malekith was cool character though,,,﻿
i fell asleep watching the trailer﻿
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help, I mean Hulk, Iron 
man, Captain America, you could have called any of them yet you choose the 
one person you can't trust.
Thor: Actually now that I think about it you're right! *Walks away*
Loki: No, come back! I was only joking! ﻿
First movie Thor was million times better than this one. Dark world is so 
boring...﻿
How come nobody else has pointed out how ANNOYING Kat Dennings is in this 
movie. Not to mention, unfunny!﻿
Those of you who want real Nordic mythology must see Valhalla!!﻿
After meeting iron man in the avengers I feel like thor got more of a sense 
of humor﻿
IM TOTALLY GOING TO WATCH THIS﻿
Shit*﻿
Horrible script! Even those awesome actors couldn't save it. Worst Natalie 
Portman performance I must say. Her little comedic effort was just 
cringeworthy. Ugh!﻿
Can someone please explain to me why the Thor movies insist on removing the 
fantasy aspects from Thor and replacing them with Science Fiction. I mean 
they literally had Asgard protected by a force field and laser canons, 
while the Dark Elves flew around on space ships. Worse they actually have 
Odin say that they aren't gods. Its like they aren't even trying to follow 
the storyline for the character.﻿
This movie was shallow. It didn't have a clear objective, just stuff 
happening. It kind of felt like a shitty episode from some tv show.﻿
Jane looks like an older Katniss﻿
Love Thor but i think this movie is only ok. ﻿
I can tell by the trailer that this movie was shit! I put it at the top of 
my queue on Netflix. Is it even worth it? Lol﻿
Movie is better than iron man 3﻿
The ending to this movie wow omg you really won't see it coming ﻿
I can't believe this movie is already out on DVD i didnt even hear much 
about it either i feel like it was only out in theatres for like 3 weeks 
haha﻿
Worse movie I have ever seen marvel should tried harder to make the movie 
great because they really fail on this one I wastr my time watching the 
movie sucks and I mean sucks ﻿
this movie sucks. Its a movie for feminists and one of those sequels that 
totally suck and are made with one purpose in mind, to cash in on THOR fans 
and previous movies which were decent compared to this piece of shit.﻿
$$$$
never even crossed my mind that superman was in this film lol﻿
[Qur'an 17:42-43]

SAHEEH INTERNATIONAL:
42. Say, [O Muhammad], "If there had been with Him [other] gods, as they 
say, then they [each] would have sought to the Owner of the Throne a way."1

1. To please Him, recognizing His superiority. Another interpretation is 
"…they would seek a way" to depose Him (subḥanahu wa ta‘ala) and take over 
His Throne.

43. Exalted is He and high above what they say by great sublimity.

[Qur'an 21:21-23]

SAHEEH INTERNATIONAL:
21. Or have they [i.e., men] taken for themselves gods from the earth who 
resurrect [the dead]?

22. Had there been within them [i.e., the heavens and earth] gods besides 
Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the 
Throne, above what they describe.

23. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.

[Qur'an 23:91-92]

SAHEEH INTERNATIONAL:
91. Allah has not taken any son, nor has there ever been with Him any 
deity. [If there had been], then each deity would have taken what it 
created, and some of them would have sought to overcome others. Exalted is 
Allah above what they describe [concerning Him].

92. [He is] Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, so high is He above 
what they associate [with Him].﻿
this movie came out on the same date as skyrim﻿
We're now returns to Man of Steel 2 Theseus Vs Ben Affleck.﻿
"Getting mythology wrong". In the trailer: "From the producer of 300" What 
did you fuckin expect ? xD﻿
cant remember any more badly directed film...everything looks fake..﻿
It basically ends with everyones heads exploding...﻿
lol. This movie sucks balls.
Just watched it. The story sucks so much after 25 min I started just 
skipping through quickly to get only the battle scenes.

But even then.. By the end I witnessed one of the worst battle scenes ever. 
First the hero's speech to the troops is a fucking joke. 2nd, when they 
start running to meet the ennemy army, lol... I'm actually still laughing 
at this. slow motion kicks in, super low bass kicks in, and then??.. like 3 
guys from the ennemy armie come in.. then like.. 3 more guys... wow... But 
that's not all. Then the hero keeps running forward through the ennemy 
troops in a fucking 6 meters wide tunnel. One more look at the ranks now 
fucking 30 meters behind him? complete void, still a couple more guys 
rushing in.

fucking 20 years ago Brave Heart was able to have fucking epic battle 
scenes with armies clashing into each others. And now we have this.. I'm 
happy I didn't sit my ass on a theater for this fiasco of a movie. Saw it 
on Netflix. Now I know why it was available so fast. thing just sucks.﻿
I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The special effects, acting and picture in 
general was fantastic despite getting mythology wrong.﻿
i don't care if they screw up the mythology, better living in a fictional 
world than the real one these days anyway.:)﻿
I wonder when movie directors will finally stop screwing up greek mythology 
:/﻿
This movie looks like absolute shit, did it ever come out?﻿
i watched this movie only because of joseph morgan﻿
1:54 .. NICE!!﻿
The movie has similar elements with the teaches of the bible, for example 
the fight between the good and the evil on the heavens and also on the 
earth too.
I would like to add that the most legends are based on real stories but 
described in a different, fantastically, exaggerated way... ﻿
Yeah, this movie was stupid, but come on. It's a Tarsem Singh movie. Of 
course it's gonna be more focused on mind blowing bizarre visuals than 
story. I knew exactly what I was getting, and I liked it.﻿
he's not even holding the string under his chin.﻿
Looks boring... And what's with the weird hats?﻿
This is what i was looking for.﻿
not as epic as I was expecting! could have been better! but hey Mickey 
Rourke is the man! always the bad guy! such a baddass!﻿
3 shots 4 arrows :)﻿
why are the greek soldiers holding gladius's?﻿
At the end of the day what ever anybody thinks of this or any movie is just 
a personal opinion, i personally loved this movie most ppl hated it﻿
I am Greek and I saw that movie. I'm sorry but is a stupid movie. Thiseas 
was the son of king of Athens Aigeas... And yes, he killed Minotavros (half 
man and half bull-taurus) but not in that way... The real story is much 
more interesting and exciting. 
More like shot 3 times, fired 4 arrows...
$$$$
I'm a man and I'll admit: the ending of this movie brought tears to my 
eyes. I remember thinking, as I wiped tears from my cheeks.. "they couldn't 
show her naked.. even once!?"

I still feel like crying.﻿
This movie was so awesome!﻿
Hot girls, crappy movie﻿
I love the movie﻿
The awesome song in the backround is panic switch by the silversun pickups, 
just in case anybody was wondering.﻿
So badgrass﻿
MY FAVORITE MOVIEEVER SINCE IT FIRST CAME OUT!!! <3﻿
Weeaboo ditz flick, who produced this, Paris Hilton and Barbie?﻿
thats what i mean when i say: GIRLPOWER!!﻿
instant cult classic that will be talked about forever. perfect. look for 
the extended cut unedited version.

10/10 rating don't miss this one!﻿
I agree this movie is underrated﻿
The full movie is soooo sad :( but sooooo Awesome!﻿
Bad*** like totally﻿
Where can you watch this movie?﻿
Keyennn﻿
It was just that the director had all these cool ass ideas and couldn't 
really make sense of all of them in the same movie so he made it look like 
a dream﻿
Brilliant movie !!﻿

"is a 2011 American fantasy action film co-written by *snyder* and Steve 
Shibuya. It is *snyder* 's first film based on an original script. The film 
stars Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie

woman who is committed to a mental institution, as she makes a plan to 
escape the hospital before suffering a lobotomy.
The film was released in both conventional and IMAX theatres in the United 
States of America at midnight on March 25, 2011. It received generally 
negative reviews from critics, and under-performed box-office expectations."

#art   #cinema   #cinemaoculum  oooo﻿
and says rotten tomaotes
i think the difference between the theatrical cut and the extended 
directors cut is MASSIVE - for starters the movie makes sense in the 
extended cut
$$$$
I was so disappointed. ﻿
Meh, not the worst comic book movie in the world but its still pretty bad, 
which pains me to say cause GL is my fav DC franchise and characters.﻿
This is a pretty epic trailer.  Shame about the actual movie.﻿
Seriously?﻿
I agree the movie had major script problems and direction problems but 
honestly Ryan Reynolds was good as Hal Jordan. No matter how you slice and 
dice it Reynolds did what he was paid for he is not the problem with the 
film at all. I do agree with the general consensus that the scene where 
Lantern actually visits Oah was far and away the highlight of the film. But 
you are kidding yourself if you really think this movie is as bad as 
"Batman and Robin" or "Elektra" or "Catwoman" - those are truly the worst 
superhero moves ﻿
this movie just need a new cast and villain. i mean reynolds and lively, 
parallax wtf...﻿
Worst movie ever﻿
I wanted so bad for this not to be horrible but there was just no way 
around it.﻿
Of all comic book movies ever made, i believe this one had the most 
potential but they blew it big time. There were a few really strong points 
in the film but the list of bad points is endless. I hope Warner Bros comes 
to their senses and really puts in the time and effort to make a reboot of 
the same quality as the comic books.﻿
It's an okay film for a Origin Story, IMO.﻿
Problems with this movie: The suit looked bad. Kilowogs voice. And 
Sinestros english accent. Ryan renolds as hal jordan. And the way it was 
directed. Hal Jordan is supposed to be like a smart ass. Not like goofy 
funny. Idk maybe thats just me.﻿
what's wrong with cgi? what do you expect, they literally film the movie on 
another planet or meeting real aliens? if you want the other green lanterns 
to be costumes then youre gonna see an even shittier quality of movie, and 
with your standards, why dont you stand up and film your own movie, not as 
easy as it looks ﻿
nice donkey laugh at  2:14﻿
that is a lot of  CGI.﻿
the movie was awesome ﻿
They've slated the villain of Part 2 to be RottenTomatoes.com and the 
empire of anal critics who obliterated Part 1's box office potential.﻿
for a truly epic wild true story Hollywood ride type in    GREEN LANTERN

A lot of people don't like this movie and I don't really understand how 
people dislike it so much. Its based on a comic book and if you read comic 
books from the late 80s to the 90s and later, you will find that the are 
really cheesy and corny. This movie is not perfectly accurate to the comics 
but its a perfectly made comic book movie. It seems that comic characters 
must be dark or anti hero's today to get anyone's attention or make it into 
the box office.  But I thought the acting and story lines were cheesy and 
corny and just like the comics I read and enjoyed it very much. The 
directors and production crew did these things on purpose. People who 
didn't read comics don't get it. Good movie I hope they make a sequel. ﻿
It's an awesome film best scene GREEN LANTERNS LIGHT!!!﻿
The movie was alright
Man did they choose him to play green lantern i hate he's face :X.

Perfect.﻿
I like the style of this movie. (a diablo II vibe(?) The endning is very 
poor though. Not only is it clear that they wanted to end the movie quickly 
with a big "boss fight" but also there's a missed chance for a 2nd movie - 
with creating some lore. As it is: I hate how the girl, after being 
defeated just come back too her normal human form - just like that. She 
ought to have some serious loos skin... at the very least!! It' just a WIN,

Glad to see this preview forgot it was out about now. Loved, National 
Treasure, Scorcere's Apprentice, Haven't seen Drive Angry, But love NC & 
Ron Perlman (Hellboy) got to be good. Looks awesome.Their are many actors, 
but some like N.Cage, R.Downey Jr., J.Deep, C.Slater are unique. But that's 
just me. Some think he's aweful. I haven't seen all his movies so I can't 
make that judgment. But I know what I like & I like N. Cage. One of my 
favorites is from NT "I would really not like to go to jail
And he's actually falling, good one! (People just randomly say this on

Best movie ever ! Not jocking, was damn fun to wach ! Violence + Bulgarian 
Tits = Perfect ! :D
Please in sequel put x2 more tits ! TY !:))﻿
shitty ass movie with second rate actors, just like all remakes﻿
Nobody else here noticed how terribly edited this movie is?? It jumps from 
scene to scene at times so badly that it just feels...well...puzzling﻿
Epic fail. Please Hollywood, next time do some soft porn shit for hordes of 
Momoa/Drogo female fans who want to make this rubbish look like a good 
movie.﻿
The only thing this Conan has going for it is that Jason Momoa LOOKS more 
like Conan from the original illustrations.  The original film and Arnold 
captured the essence of the source material 1000 times more than this 
superficial nonsense did.﻿
I enjoyed the remake of Conan the barbarian much more then the original 
with Arnold. This conans so sexy bruh omg. I was drooling.﻿
He looks alot like the conan from the xbox and playstation game , i really 
liked this movie because of that , i dont like arnolds accent srry﻿
best movie ever﻿
Eh... wont be seaking this out. As a Conan fan, this doesn't seem to do the 
character justice. Overproduced. Giant unreal castles. Gritty but too 
modern... fake grit.﻿
Terminator Genesis will be way better and a lot Superior to this stupid 
rubbish movie.﻿
whats the song at 0:44 its not end of the universe I know it anyone know 
the song at 0:44 if you know it respond please﻿
I've just realized...That Conan and Khal Drogo are played by the same 
guy... :D﻿
nice movie i liked it﻿
Isn't that khal drogo from game of thrones, I think his name is jason momoa
﻿
Loved this movie, it was well done.
And Jason is a good actor and very tough.
The old move was Okay.I think Conan was to pretty in the old movies movie, 
dont get me wrong it was good for its time.

but this is not the worst remake  ﻿
Conan , the vegetarian﻿
Ugly half nigger with greasy spic hair jumping around like a monkey with 
shit cgi work. Unspeakably bad movie. I feel bad for the women who had to 
be in this 0/10 niggerfest film.﻿

Biggest pile of poor scripting and bad directing I've seen in twenty years 
- ended up walking out of the cinema after half-an-hour it was just such 
rubbish (worse even that Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Brat).

this movie was honestly terrible.﻿
All these remakes that are being released are crap. Hollywood is ****ing 
up.﻿
shit movie﻿
$$$$
So this is like Open Your Eyes and Vanilla Sky but bad and without a smart 
plot?﻿
I think it would've been better if they included how, like it was said in 
the book, Adrian/Kyle was turned into a full beast. Not that I don't like 
the scar idea; I just think it'd make the point more clear that beauty's 
underneath﻿
fucl<﻿
This movie was really disappointing and Alex Pettyfer's acting was so 
awkward :/
I love Neil Patrick Harris though c: ﻿
Love this movie he looks hot with the scars too the more damaged the more i 
like them﻿
Beauty and the Beast ﻿
Alex is ugly and unattractive? Hell no. The witch has done a terribly bad 
job making him look ugly. ﻿
i ain't gonna lie, i watched this movie for the eye candy. and damn it was 
worth it.﻿
if I could've chose the actors, I wouldn't have chose Vanessa. she doesn't 
seem 'right' for this type of movie! she's a great actress and all...just I 
don't think in this type of movie...﻿
alex is perfect for the part as thats what he is in real life..but vanessa 
as beauty? im disgusted.﻿
Awh I forgot about this movie! I actually really liked it!﻿
they messed up SO MUCH STUFF IN THE BOOK!﻿
With all my stretch marks, I feel like a beast but there is no magic that 
will undo those scars.﻿
"Mary poppins" *smile*
 EPIC﻿

I only watched this for NPH, it was absolutely horrendous with terrible 
acting ﻿

The only thing i liked about this was Neil. He was just so funny XD﻿
It's a good movie :) ﻿
actually, i think the witch is beautiful, she has her own style lol﻿
Everyone, the song in the background is called "hey boys and girls" and 
it's by an nz band called Evermore :)﻿
Whatever happened to LOVE?-Truest question ever. ﻿

Vanessa is such a great actress. Wow! ﻿

I like the silver chair more.

Love this movie its amazing and full action pack film ! ! ! <3﻿
I thought it was a good movie...
its ruined
very digressing.
i don't get why so many people disliked this film, i thought it was 
spectacular! loved hatter and chesh, 
I wish Avril Lavigne played the role alice.
You know this isn't suppose to be like the first book. I'm a mad Alice fan 
and I love things to be like the originals so take my word for it, this 
film is fantastic.
But in the movie they said that this happens /after/ the books... like she 
thought those were dreams but they really weren't, etc....
I bet this movie is other than expected when you watch this trailer before 
going to the cinema. The trailer makes the movie look funnier than it 
actually is. I liked the movie but I was not expecting it the way it was.
Watch it is captions. XD
boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooring
my favorite movie when I was little :D 
Indeed
this tkaes place years after this, 
That's true,although people might have wondered what she'd be like as an 
adult.
THUMBS UP IF YOU WISH AVRIL LAVIGNE WAS ALICE 
This movie was her returning to Wonderland years later
There is a sequel in the making :) 
"Were all made here" Best like ever.
Am i the only one that wants to un-see this movie so i can remember being 
excited for it?
It's a mix of both. The story is mainly based on "Alice in Wonderland" but 
many elements from "Through the Looking-Glass" have been taken over, 
probably to make the story more epic. For example they put the Jabberwocky 
in to give Alive a monster to slaughter. However the movie is neither a 
retelling of Wonderland nor of Looking-Glass, because it takes place ten 
years after Alice's first visit in Wonderland.
BEST FANTASY FILM EVER :-D LOVE THE WORKS OF TIM BURTON :-D
$$$$
So under rated!﻿
I actually really liked this movie!﻿
I've noticed alot of the bits in this trailer are scenes in reverse from 
the movie.

this movie is amazing just ordered it on dvd a few days ago and also Dastan 
is Gorgeouse ;) 
@Philawockeez great review man but i wouldnt say cheesy acting... have you 
seen avatar the last airbender*
@L2edit last i heard, they'll begin working on an AC movie after the third 
game. (brotherhood wasnt the third, it was the second part to the second 
game) they'll announce something on the upcoming AC franchise by the end of 
this month.
@nodirbekable It can only rewind time by a few minutes.
If they wanted to make a Movie about Persia, rather would have the film go 
about Cyrus the Great. Not, Prince Dastan..
hey,is the Prince aragorn from lotr?
i think they should definetely do warrior within.
$$$$
Who is the blond chick???
looks freaking awesome!
I thought so too but I couldn't see clearly enough. Do you think it is? I 
only see one broom?
anything with nicholas cage in is crap so i won't bother.
hey sweet they even have the brooms
this film looks good but hasnt done very well
when is this coming out? 
1:54 is that a spellcast circle? i thoght that spellcast circles had 4 
circle inside em one for each element not 6 .....
Normally I cannot stand Cage, everything about him bothers me. But he seems 
almost perfect for this can't wait to see it.
trailer needs some work to attract more audience. The trailer is just so-so
If you saw this on Disney Channel, I did and they play a song in the 
commercial that goes "Tell me what you want to keep"And that's the only 
part I know. Haha. But listen to that part, and if you know that song 
please tell me what it is cuz I really want to know. lol Thanks!! [[=
I was expecting mickey... i guess I was wrong... it's better!!
@TheAngelSpeaks15 I know right?
i seen this already :) its great
@SnowyCone99 this one,..duh!
O_o interesting
horrible
one of the few disney movies i would consider watching
one of my favorite movie.. firstly , nicholas cage was one of my fave actor 
and 2ndly this movie was great :))))
where is mickey??
LOL you never know. there just might be broomsticks for comical relief. xD
@TomoexNanami lol probably!
Me and Nikki's got da same hair-style! Yippeeee!
nope.
2:17 LOL. just a bit.
$$$$
Whats the song﻿
Release the Kraken! Everytime Liam Neeson gets it on with hes wife.
Aren't they always? >:p
Hades: "someday i will unleash the KRAKEN ZEUS: "RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!" 
Best phrase " RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!"
i've just realised that she is out of Prince of Persia: Sands of Time lol x
Yes definately ;)
Trailer was better than the movie
I thought this was really good.﻿
None
$$$$
I dont blame the actors, i blame the director for all of the things wrong 
with this film. i DO love the cast and i did like the change in ages 
instead of starting off being 11. 
I mean i still like the movies, but for someone whos read the books too i 
wish it couldve been done way more closely to the books. Harry Potter was 
great and Hunger Games is great and it had small changes, but oh well. Lets 
hope Divergent is good, and the Mockingjay films. ﻿
"Take it, it will protect you"
"It's a pen"
"Come on, take it"
"It's a pen!"﻿
OK, I read the book like a few months ago, and it's one of my favorite 
books, no joking. Until this movie I watched just a few days ago; it's my 
first time watching it. Then this, "HOW THE HELL DID YOU GUYS GET THIS 
DIRECTOR?". OK, the movie was good, I respect their work and copyrights, 
but they let this down, badly. It's like every minute of the movie, they 
skipped at least 5 pages (include one page from Anabeth's description and 
attitude) from the book! Same thing like the other one (didn't watch it 
yet, but I've seen people disagree with that) from that same director. I 
recommended to them to replace another director that has good taste of the 
third one.﻿
Hey guys! If you'd like, do check out https://www.fanfiction.net/u/3437437/or 
https://www.fanfiction.net/~turtledynasty :) I compose mostly stories base 
on the the following themes: friendship and adventure... with a very 
minimal tinge of romance because that isn't the controlling theme I plan to 
give across in my stories. (It's unnecessary to the plot, but just in 
case... for the people who are romantic at heart <3)

Percy Jackson fanfic is one of them. :) So go on and visit the link if 
you're interested!﻿
Annabeth is supposed to have blond hair ﻿
I don't understand why the newspapers and so critisised this movie and the 
second one so much. I like them very much. :)﻿
This is a pen! :D﻿
I can't wait to see the movie!﻿
What about Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Titan's Curse?

Just so everyone knows, the title - "The Titan's Curse" refers to the 
Titan: Atlas and the Curse: Holding the sky.﻿
Doesn't Annebeth have blonde hair?﻿
I'm crying... I watched this trailer so many times before it came out.... I 
was so excited-the movie came out on my birthday and I was watching it with 
my 6 best friends... And it just was so freaking bad that I'm still not 
over it﻿
Just watched this yesterday! And it's so good that i enjoyed so much. Now 
looking forward to watching the next movie! :)﻿
My best friend got me to read the book. At first I didn't want to because I 
like harry potter, but now I love, I mean, I guess I'm an olimpian now.﻿
Sorry, but they changed the whole plot in the movie. The book is so much 
better, I bet you have heard that a million times but it really is. I felt 
as if the beginning of the movie was rushed﻿
Ok why Annabeyh has brown hair in the first movie and blond in the second 
one??﻿
And annebeth and percy don't kiss in 1.part﻿
So we all agree this was one of the worst book to movie adaptations ever.
But, "This is a pen...This is a PEN." Cracks me up anyways.﻿
It's a powerfull weapon (Chiron)
It's a pen (percy)
Click it (Grover) 
Oh my gods !!! 

Lol ﻿
Did they even READ the book? I read the whole series and annabeth is always 
a blonde﻿
people, u guys need to understand that if a movie is exactly like the book 
it's no fun cause u know waht's gonna happen. i still agree Annabeth has to 
have blonde hair and grey eyes. i have been looking for this movie for AGES
best book series ever﻿
Anabet﻿
Yeah, I really did enjoy the movie. But it bugged me how there were so many 
things different about it. I mean there while quest was different! Also 
Percy left his mother behind, not Grover. I mean they were suppose to be 
like 12 and in 6th grade! Also Annabeth was blond! I know, I mean all 
movies have to make a few changes, but the whole fricken story was 
different! I wish people would stick to the books just a bit more.﻿
Grover is completely different in the movie.﻿
SPOILER : Sean Bean dies. lol you've already knew that !﻿
Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief

Brain off and vodka in hand, and this his a fun film with problems.  It 
probably would have appealed to me when I was a young teen and I can 
appreciate what was done, introducing the world of Greek mythology to the 
teenage market.

I do have to say the fight choreography is bluntly not very good.  Athena's 
daughter looks like she doesn't want to be anywhere near the blade she's 
toting.

still, light fun.﻿
$$$$
This movie was extremely shitty. ﻿
I think they were better off making a cartoon movie﻿
The worse and painful movie of all times with terrible acting.﻿
this movie was..................the faggotest gayest stupidest film i ever 
seen and a waste of money  while watching it felt like they rushed and 
didnt even bother to do research on the cartoon and didnt really put a 
little of brand new or cool ideas and WTF! firebenders had to break a lamp 
or something that has fire in order to bend it that right there just forced 
me to laugh and walk out the theater and they put like all the books and 
shit on one film i mean they couldve at least focused on book 1 and came up 
with a shitload of ideas but nooo they put it on one film thats why its 
called a GODDAMN SEQUEL ﻿
This is so so so wrong﻿
The cartoon brings all my emotions up in just one episode but this movie.. 
I wanted to cry cause its the worst thing they couldve done to such a great 
story and tv show﻿
Naww, I still remember when I watched this movie the first time with a 
friend, we were so excited because we just love the TV show. But 
eventually, the movie completely sucked. You can't even compare the movie 
with the TV show, because it's so bad. Yeah, I'm being harsh, but 
seriously. Just bullshit.﻿
I heard he only made the film because his daughters loved the show, m 
night, some father...........﻿
The show had charm and funny moments, but the movie is fucking depressing.﻿
Compared to the television series and the comics this film was terrible, 
the only good things about it were the special effects (which were used to 
compensate for the bad acting) and Dev Patel (the portrayer of Zuko and the 
only good actor in the entire film). I know there have been alot of outrage 
with regards to the casting choice and ethnicity of the actors chosen 
(believe me I was annoyed with the choices too) but the creators of the 
television show, who served as producers of the film, probably thought the 
audience wouldn't mind since they used American voice actors to portray the 
original characters and so wouldnt make much of a difference - wrong! The 
film lacked the humour and the original personalities of the characters, 
everyone was just too serious. I hope if they ever do a remake of this film 
they stick to the originality of the television series and make it more 
light hearted rather than the "you are the chosen one" seriousness cliche 
crap (excuse my language) that's going around alot lately :-)﻿
The trailer actually looks very solid. The movie, however, was painfully 
awful. Such great potential gone to waste. A true shame. M. Night.﻿
The trailer makes it look so awesome! 

And then reality sets in.﻿

This movie shoud just go die﻿
I came here just to hate and dislike this blood and shit bending, scraps. 
Anyone who create something this bad should be put to death﻿
Bad acting. Bad special effects. Horrible casting. They didn't get a single 
character right.
Worst of all, they tried to jam a 7 hour long story (book 1) into one short 
movie.﻿
It's just not good. It's, like, making fun of the series.. ﻿
This movie is/was really disapointing. Even the bending looks fake. The 
fights are odd, you see the enemy clearly waiting each turn to attack....
why is sokka a total buzz kill
I don't know what Shyamalan was thinking with who he cast in the movie, 
especially Jackson Rathbone. My main criticism was the script and the 
pacing though, they're what hurt the movie the worst. 
if we compare the sroty to the animated serie, thern yes you can disprove, 
but for a neutral watcher , this movie is really good !! great visual 
effects , great fantasy touch...i liked it.
90% of the actors are from Bollywood 
I saw Thorin.
Uhm... The firebenders can be tan like indians, earth kingdom chinese 
like... water benders white..? (Not being racist, sorry) .-.
Everyone complains how "this movies is bad or crap", well their wrong. This 
is to shit to even classify as a movie....
Worst movie ever dude -.-
$$$$
Woww...there is actually no need to see the movie after watching this 
trailer.﻿
I'm watching Nanny McPhee Returns on TV﻿
Poor Celia :( her brand new shoes! And white! Covered in poo. She shouldn't 
have stepped in it in the first place though.﻿
When I watch the movie. At the end of the movie the old women is named 
Eggy. Isn't Eggy the Baby in the first nanny mcphee movie?
you know there is a bau bau here in the first half of the trailer she has 
moles in the second she doesn't but some how she looks uglier with out the 
moles.
worst idea.. wTF looks the same but with different kids EPIC FAIL
SO MUCH SPAM
@karishini1 its bruno from boy in the striped pyjamas too

Cow
Big thanks for the trailer...:)
72 people are idiots

I love this movie! But Asa is theee bessstt!!!
Ok. I am officially utterly confused. I started watching a Nanny McPhee 
movie about 2/3 years ago. Now I hear about a Nanny McPhee Returns movie, 
and everywhere I look, it seems like the same old movie. Link to the two 
different movies please. Would appreciate it. 
Mary Poppins but fugly
Cow

@2:12 McGonagall impressed by Trelawney

nothing special.﻿
I.

It is a pretty good movie. Anna is so funny.﻿
Hi residents, we now have "Frozen" on DVD and Blu-ray! You can stop by the 
office and check it out!﻿
Olaf is soooo funny especially the scene with the trolls I died laughing﻿
0:17, you could see original evil elsa :D﻿
I like the movie except is it a movie or a song sometimes i get confused.﻿
1:41 that was not in the movie.﻿
I like how this trailer makes it seem like Elsa is the bad guy...﻿
a good movie﻿
welcome to the movie which has most deleted scences, most unfinished plots 
starring forever alone anna a snowman who only purpose is to make it 
funnier and the wickedly talented adele dazeem #honest #trailer  ﻿
Guess im guna see what all this let it go crap is about...﻿
Dan was a liar, Anna is Gossip Girl!﻿
:D﻿
This movie sucks ass.﻿
Reminds me of Narnia...
What is the song before that; Oh oh oh oh oh-oh Oh oh oh oh oh-oh.... That 
song from the beginning of the trailer isn't 'Harlem' but I can't find it :(
would have been cool if they didnt spoil that it was her sister? what a 
huge spoiler, ruins the run of watching that part.
Can't wait!♥
Cant wait! :)
And I thought Tangled was my only favorite CGI movie.
What is this song called, 1:54
greet Demi Lovato - Let It Go :)
$$$$
0:17 same voice actor as Pearl from SpongeBob?﻿
Whats the final song???﻿
.﻿
My six year old self is so happy right now!﻿

Nothing less to expect from Pixar studios. Great animation and nice cute 
story for the whole family. But nothing new. Still scaring kids to get 
their power. Now they need to learn teamwork. There is no I in 'team'. But 
ther is an I in 'you can do It for me' xD 5.7/10
#trailer   #animation   #monster   #competition  ﻿

I hope they make a third one, I just love Despicable Me so much! ^^﻿

boss I loved th movie also﻿
POOKEEALUPATA!!!!!!!!﻿
i seed this on the xbox 360 and i love the song﻿

LOVE LOVE the fact that eminem is in the background﻿
Eminem is in this trailer. Love this c;﻿
Margo: What celeb do you look like?
Gru: Bruce Willis?
Margo: No.
Agnes: Humpty Dumpty!﻿
it has got subliminal message﻿
Who was the shadow of a mysterious figure approaches Gru's front door?﻿
music at 1:05? eminem im pretty sure but idk what song?﻿
I am seeing this movie today﻿
I love it﻿
So I watched this trailer before this movie came out. Seemed normal. But 
today I was listening to Eminem's "Without Me," and recalled it from the 
trailer of this. My favorite song on my favorite movie's trailer :)﻿
WITHOUT MEEEEEEEEEEEE﻿
It doesn't matter UNLESS IT'S A BOY!﻿
Hihi botum ( best part )﻿
emnim without me them song﻿
i love agnes! shes my fav!﻿
"what the.. whoa!" 1:28﻿

Quite a lot of puns in this movie...﻿
This is a decent sequel to my favorite Sony film. My only problems with it 
is it's message, charather design and the wide vary of food puns. But it's 
colorful and creative.﻿
this movie was so cute﻿
Saspa!﻿
I just mentioned a movie I tried to like, but I just could not. Now this is 
a movie that I tried to hate, but I actually ended up really liking, maybe 
even better than the first one. I remember how much fun I had with the 
first, which was quite strange, but good. This one looked too odd, so I 
didn't go see it in theaters. I actually saw it on dvd rental when I 
finally decided to give in. And yea, it was weird, and I tried so hard to 
hate it. But as I watched it it really grew on me, and heck the animation 
was great, and the story was too along with most of the comedy. And this 
one actually has a villian with an assistant, henchman, and loads of 
technology. And the foodimals, were quite cool and creative in their names 
and design, and so were the food plants and just the whole new island. The 
characters do well too. Overall, I actually really like this movie, 
definetly one of my favorite animated movies of 2013. Overall Rating: 7﻿
Hey I know this movie its just like a combination of dinosaurs with 
different  sizes of animals and insects in the jungle but they where made 
in fruits XD
however it so interesting and fun to watch :)﻿
Nwoo?﻿
much food very yummi wow﻿
It's pretty obvious that the main antagonist is suppose be Steve Jobs, and 
Life Corp is Apple. Trololololz﻿
Ooooooh, so that's where the Fighting Foodons came from!﻿
yify﻿
So. Many. Food. Puns﻿
nice﻿
I love this movie! funny food puns!<3﻿

Saw this movie today on Netflix and it was amazing! Great acting, 
extraordinary animation and a great story! Surprised it didn't get much 
attention. Everyone knows Rio and Ice age so why not this? Great cast. 
Beyonce, Amanda Seyfried, Colin Farel, Pitbull. This movie should have made 
way more money for blue sky studios but it didn't even make it to theatres.﻿
Cool movie, check it out on HBO or on demand. Beyoncé plays Queen Tara! I 
love her voice in this!﻿
Ice Age? I really don't see any relation to that, but Rio I understand﻿
I really love this movie and it's just... Epic as the title says! I'm sad 
that it hasn't got a lot of attention! Actually none of Dream Works' movies 
have got the attention they deserve! I mean only Disney movies become 
massive hits but movies like Epic, Rio and Ice Age aren't that big thing! ﻿
THAT SONG! i know it <3﻿
Trailer was better than the freaking movie. ﻿
I loved this movie! It made smile a lot! It's my very favorite movie. But 
Spirit will always be my #1. Nothing can pass it for me. but I also like 
The Shrek Movies, Flushed Away, The Lorax, Tangled, Ice Age Movies, The 
Incredibles, Chicken Little, Rise Of The Guardians, Hotel Transylvania, 
Wrek It Ralph, Up, Over The Hedge, Cars, Cars 2, Puss In Boots, Despicable 
Me, Despicable Me 2, Monsters Inc, Monsters University, Mega Mind, Rango, 
Hood Winked, Hood Winked too, The Madagascar Movies, The Open Season 
Movies, Finding Nemo, Gnomeo And Juliet, Kung Fu Panda, Kung Fu Panda 2, 
And The Croodsl I loved ALL OF THoSE MOVIES AND STILL DO DESPITE BEING 13. 
XD Those were my favorite ones. And I have All of those on DVD. My Mom 
collects them anyway! :D My most favorite 2 are The Croods and Epic! I wuv 
those both!﻿
this movie was really cute and the animation of the nature was just 
breathtaking! but the ending was a wee bit disappointing but still really 
good overall!﻿
The trailer was way better than the movie, this is like Jarhead all over 
again.﻿
Done watching it :) the animation was soo great. Greeny green. Its deserves 
a sequel! the love story did not have a happily ever after :) . The snails 
were funny . Very nice movie tho Its just like The Secret World of Arriety. 
Same ending as well but this one.. they both keep in touch. ﻿
The Lightning Strike-Snow Patrol﻿
Im watching this right now on fox movies premium :) epic premiere!:) ﻿
No more talking sluts﻿
What is the song ﻿
Was expecting this movie to be a 6/10, turned out to be a 7/10 *Success Kid*
﻿
Good thing I came here to listen to a song instead of watching a trailer...﻿
Just watched it, it was amazing!! Absolutely loved it. It was so different 
and the animation was gorgeous. ﻿
Snow patrol -What if the storm end﻿
Aaawwww :) very cute and amazingly charming. We enjoyed watching this one a 
lot. Good humor and amazing animated nature. Just nice 7.6/10
#trailer   #movie   #animation   #miniature  ﻿
This movie could have done without that slug and snail. They were trying to 
be funny, but they weren't.﻿
Okay, story time:
I saw this trailer, and was BLOWN away, the song fit perfectly and the 
animation was amazing. I was thinking that Blue Skies had finally matured 
and was going to make a really good drama movie. I waited all fucking year, 
went the first day it came out...and was disapointed with the result.
It wasn't bad, but it missed out on SO many opportunities, it could have 
been as good as a fucking Disney or PIXAR movie, but it fell flat. Stories 
with tiny people are my favourite, and I saw Secret World of Artiety a few 
days after that, and it was much better.

Kind of a pointless story, but I really had my hopes up for this movie. I 
hope Blue Skies works more on their story and character development, 
they're getting there.  ﻿
good but illuminatic﻿
every one i watched this movie on megashare.info for free
In my opinion, Lightning Strike did not at all fit with this trailer. 
Especially in the beginning, it simply did not belong.

This was an absolutely beautiful movie. I wish more people I knew had 
wanted to see it. ﻿
Watched The Croods yesterday and thought this story was so very relevant to 
today's corporate world. Replace the word Family by the word Business, and 
you have a complete analogy of what it takes for a business to survive. 
Ideas, creativity, looking outside your cave, use of new technology... 
Happy watching.﻿
i really love this movie and i will never ever get bored of watching it 
again and again :))﻿
This movie was AMAZING!!!! 5 stars***** It's on Netflix, see for yourself.﻿
This is one brilliant animation movie! Great in every aspect. Looking

Every family must watch this movie. The most awesome, fantastic, fabulous

lesson of family values. 10 stars movie!!! Thank you﻿

Yourselfs!!﻿
This movie impressed me c:  It turned out to be a lot more than I expected 
it to be - 
It has Dreamworks sweetness, great characterization, and it really shows 
the idea of a family in a different light than it has been portrayed so 
often in the past with respect to the concepts of change and evolution.  If 
anyone out there is skeptical about giving it a shot, give it a watch - a 
pretty sweet movie.  ﻿

It's sad what this foreshadows.﻿
This looks fun :-D﻿
is this movie worth watching?﻿
Owen Wilson can't act for his life.﻿
I enjoyed this movie well, but I'm far more excited for certain movies like 
the Lego Movie and the Muppets 2.﻿
The movie was great but it wont stop me from eating turkey every thanks 
giving . This movie was an anti thanksgiving by the liberals . Trying to 
get people to brake off tradition . What the stupid part of this movie was 
they had the Indians eat Pizza that made me a little angry . Who in their 
right mind would eat Pizza during thanks giving  I can under stand ham for 
a substitute for those who don't like to eat turkey . ﻿
Turkeys and Chickens star in a new BlockBuster movie.

It will also change your mind about Giving THanks!﻿
1:00 

But they didn't eat turkeys at the first Thanksgiving D:﻿
A really good film:

Free Birds - Official Trailer (HD) Owen Wilson﻿
DO YOU KNOW YOUR ENEMEY!!!!﻿
this *really* seems like a rip off of "chicken run"...﻿
I know I'm going to get hate, but this is a historical error. Ironically, 
the first thanksgiving wasn't in Plymouth: it was in St Augustine, Florida.
Also, this movie sucked.﻿
actually such a boring movie.. 2 hours I'm never going to get back :(
What would be the next animation animal hero after fish
(nemo) , snail (plains) , parrot (rio), turkey (free birds) ?﻿
hhhhhmmmm awesome﻿
I think I would only see this movie for the guys in the yellow hazard 
suits. They tell my kind of jokes... lame as shit ones. ﻿
1:25 *omfg I died*  xD﻿
So AIM troopers vs. turkeys... I like it lol ﻿
With cranberry sauce.

-Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehe﻿
So, the president is kinda like Clinton? Timely.  Afraid to poke fun at the 
almighty Hopeandchange?﻿
This i gonna be...AWESOME!﻿
pizza is the solution for peace﻿
i watched this movie and......... i didnt understand the point ?!﻿
songs 0:28--0:40 Green Day: "Know Your Enemy

Amazing and beautiful, the animated history of Laurent Boileau/Jung Henin, 
a boy stuck in the crossroads of culture, serves as a hearthstone and 
window to the flavored experience of adoption.

Wow. Just wow. 

Animated documentary "Approved for Adoption": http://youtu.be/ecSk8hijonc﻿
considering this takes place after the Korean war, this literally has 
nothing to do with "kids these days". that kid was born in the 50's
looks interesting. ill definetly watch it.
Agreed, looks very nice. A different kind of "anime" for a change. Looks a 
bit like the style in the "The Walking Dead"-game, and I loved that style! 
Will watch :D
this kid looks like he needs more understanding parents
Wish I could be in France to watch this :)
Good for him? I don't know... It's silly when you think about it, how 
people wage war over stupid ideals and pretexts (i'm looking at you 
'merica). Korean boys rule!
time for a Feel Trip
Tão giroooo! 
You know how contradicting that sounds. If the boy was vietnamese, you 
would be right, but Korean War actually has a strong significance and 
meaning to South Korea, fighting for freedom from N. Korean forces and won 
thanks to a risky counter-attack in Incheon lead by MacArthur and US 
forces. This is Korean War, not Vietnam where they messed up, US forces 
actually did something meaningful. South Korea is now a powerful 
economic/technological force. They even have a statue of MacArthur in Korea.
I wish there is an English dove.
This looks excellent.
Obviously no one is going to adopt you, silly kid. No one wants children 
who can't behave... Self absorbed bastards, not thinking how hard it is for 
us parents to make them happy. Honestly children these days are very 
spoiled with their iPhones and such. Know what i do to my children when 
they ask for an iPhone? I give them a spanking and then i punished them by 
buying them a Windows Phone! And that kids is sarcasm, or some twisted form 
of it, stupid internet and it's inability to allow sarcasm.
awesome. 
Prity touching.... probably amazing to watch!
i haven't seen it....but that's almost like my life story =) it's gotta be 
good.

Looks amazing
esta peli se ve buena, ojalá tenga oportunidad de verla.﻿

where is the polybius scene?﻿
POLYBIUS IS IN THIS TRAILER!!! THE US GOVERNEMNT IS BEHIND THIS!!!!!﻿
Whoever watched the movie, do u guys remember b4 ralph leave sugar rush he 
said "to be continue". U no what that means.......SEQUEL!!!!!!﻿
In my opinion, this movie was better than Frozen and Tangled combined.﻿
Wreck it ralph needs a sequel immediately.﻿
ive heard there is a sora in this video. didnt found it﻿
I hope there's a sequel.﻿
Anyone else notice that they used the old EPCOT font in this trailer?﻿
Does anyone call this movie their favorite just cause Sonic's in it?﻿
Loved this film! So fun, family friendly and even emotional.
It's one of my favourites along with Wolf Children.﻿
Hmm... I don't think Zangief is really a bad guy. I mean in his ending in 
SF4 all the children really seem to love him. Although most of his 
appearances outside of the games are evil. In his cameo in Breath of Fire 3 
he was a dick, and he was bad in the Streef Fighter movie. I guess that is 
just his image.﻿
Still waiting for #2﻿
Screw my PS4 ... I'm going back to the arcade!﻿
I loved this movie; funny, fast, smart. Probably one of the best animated 
movies I have ever seen, the character of Vanellope is fantastic, and im 
telling you, im no sissy, but a scene or two almost made me shed a tear 
This is definately in my top 3 with Toy Story and Wall-E﻿
what song is at 1:39?﻿
I had my doubts about this film back in Summer 2012... then I saw this 
trailer, and thought "Yeah, this is gonna be legit."﻿
fortunately "some nights" is not in the movie itself, i hate that song﻿
I think Wreck-it-Ralph should get it's very own show on Disney channel! :)﻿
Does someone in here feelling like me? I wacth one of disney movie! After I 
watch one movie! I want to know more about them, you know, watch more about 
them! I don't know how to describe it accurately! When I sleep, I 
always Imagine more about their story! Just like crazy ... :D
I love Wreck-It Ralph! I love movie about game! :D If you is an Indie Game, 
you will love something talking about game! :D﻿
I love this movie so much! I came in expecting humor and to see my favorite 
gaming characters, and left with a new perspective for life, and goals we 
set, and challenges we face. Everytime the movie ends with that line, "If 
that little kid likes me, how bad can i be?" I just want to break down and 
cry. Disney, well done. Just well done.﻿
I absolutely love this movie!! And this trailer was perfect for it! :)﻿
Its funny when I laugh when watching the trailer but get emotional when 
watching the full movie﻿
Have some time? Wanna see a bit geeky, cute an funny movie. Than your 
choice is: Wreck it Ralph!﻿
how's named the song from 1:34
Yes, I remember that movie, I've watched it like at least a few times.
$$$$
So I can't purchase this film? Where do I go to see it?﻿
Yeah this doesn't look like something I'd watch on a bad day  xD﻿
This barely suggests the depth and breadth of the animation and 
storytelling of this film. Hooray for Chris Sullivan and Tribeca Film 
Festival!﻿
i saw it at a screening at my university. I've been searching for a 
download ever since :(
This is pretty much how reality feels like when you have been awake for 48 
hours and then opened up a bottle of red wine to calm the nerves and 
prevent panic attacks.
WTF DID I JUST WATCH......UNSUBSCRIBED
did you download? How did you do it. 
can you ask him when the dvd comes out? 
is an artistic movie possibly short film?
Looks like an animated portrayal on the frailties and shortcomings of what 
it is to be a human being.
WHAT DA &*^%
russian cartoon with english voice acting is what i see
Great movie
Great film. Saw this last night, guy next to me a
looks interesting
where can this movie be downloaded? I can't find it anywhere...
saw this yesterday, and the film is the most painful... most beautiful 
thing id ever seen. it took 15 years to make, everything done by hand... 
appreciate the work put into this. dont say WTF just cuz its not the kind 
of industrial product you're used to.
I know right? Some people just don't seem to appreciate the work that can 
go into these kinds of movies and can only judge a book by it's cover, but 
than again this is Youtube we're talking about, so it doesn't really 
surprise me. I'm going to see this animator next week at my college and i 
can't wait to hear what he has to say about this project. I'am bound to 
learn a thing or two from him. So inspiring. :)
where can i buy/find this film?
Where can I see this move?
Anyone who claims you need to engage in any form of recreational drug use 
in order to properly experience this movie, or any movie for that matter is 
an idiot.
saw it at a screening. i cant find a download :(
Sullivan is amazingly talented. His student film, The Beholder made such an 
impression on me when I saw it at a film festival in 1992 that I remembered 
his name all the way until now! Saw the review in the Wall Street Journal 
for this film. Glad to read that he is finally seeing the release of this 
film. I can't wait to see it!
Had a rock n mustache. It was good but didn't make a lot of sense til later 
in the story
He is my teacher and his work is extremely thought provoking and 
intellectual. It is very telling of his own personality 
$$$$
I sa the movie and i criend really hard..﻿
I love this movie! :D﻿

Tim Burton has the wildest imagination ever
thats to bad. It is sad, and scary. But at least they are building up a 
good immune to scary and sad stuff.
hi 
why is it in black and white ?? 
why the movie is black and white :"(
nice trailer
$$$$
Movie was deep, especially towards the end.﻿
Too much stupid characters but I guess thats comedy. Hope the money this 
movie made gets invested in something more serious and original like 
coraline.﻿
micheal myers﻿
very nice and meaningful for kids, and maybe for adults, too!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
I like Coraline, but I absolutely LOVE ParaNorman....WEIRD KIDS OF THE 
WORLD, UNITE!!!! *fist pump*﻿
LOL Who would have thought that Mitch Downe would be gay. Hahah ﻿
The ending made me cry :(

But I LOVED this movie
It has an All-Star Cast: Kodi Smit-McPhee, Tucker Abziri, Anna Kendrick, 
Casey Affleck, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Leslie Mann, Jeff Garlin, and John 
Goodman﻿
It's funny, 'cause I have a friend with the same last name as Norman﻿
I friggin loved this movie. The ending gave me goosebumps. (Not the creepy 
kind)﻿
ParaNormanMal.. lalala~﻿
Awsome movie﻿
This movie....

was AMAZING.

It wasn't just a normal zombie-kiddie film. It had a powerful message. And 
the animation was beautiful. But the messages....so deep. It was amazing :

Everybody in the faculty was like, "Seriously? A cartoon?"

Me: No it's not. It is PARANORMAN. And the heck I care if you find it 
awkward seeing a grown up so engrossed into kiddie flicks.﻿
Hehehe! Norman is so funny :D﻿
Looks like something I might like. :-)﻿
I just watched the movie *ParaNorman* with my nieces. It had a good lesson 
for kids and adults. Watch it with your kids if you have kids.﻿
Saw Paranorman.

It is one thing to go to a movie with high expectations. But then to go and 
become an overwhelmed puddle because of what you saw. What you experienced. 
Rendered speechless from so much and more.

It is astonishingly beautiful. The details in the characters, the 
transparency of the skin, the wetness in the lip gloss. The incredible 
production design. Incredible animation. Outstanding on every level.

Fricken hilarious. It has an amazing sense of humor but also a keen sense 
for the macabre. The balance of comedy and horror is perfect.

But it's not just that. This is a very important film. The things it 
teaches you about fear, about anger. I could spend hours talking about it. 
The final 20 minutes left me with my mouth open in complete awe.

You must see this movie, you'll kick yourself if you miss it. This is what 
you've been wishing for.

Now. GO!﻿
Awesome!

out,
t﻿
*ParaNorman (2012)*  I just watched this and thought it was an excellent 
horror comedy.  Great for both the kiddos and adults.  Funny stuff.... 
great zombies and ghosts, too.

I previously thought this was computer animated to look like the 
stop-motion process.  Turns out... it really is a stop-motion film.  Pretty 
cool.﻿
ParaNorman coming to the theatre......check the Movie out......﻿
A nice stop motion movie :)﻿
Can't wait to see this with the kiddos this morning!﻿

@johndnumber3 Is Thatt Doctor Who?!
I thought this movie looked really funny and cute, but it's not. It's so 
boring and felt so long. My kids barely sat through it.
looks like one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time
@217hman So you can tell us if it's good? :p
You mean Surprisingly curvaceous pirate? I love that they never address 
that. 
ok was it just me, or did the pirate with the orange beard.... look like a 
woman in disguise..?
i love claymations, wallace in grumatt was the best
the pirate with the orange beard looks like a garden gnome...to me
Question: at the 1:02- 1:04 mark, why are there CHEMTRAILS in the sky. Call 
me a conspiracy theorist, but I don't see the relevence for the sky to 
appear like that, unless they want to brainwash kids into thinking that's 
how the sky is supposed to look like...

@yondaime4000 it's claymation

OCTOBER 23 2013, 10 pm eastern time
This movie was sooo AWESOME. :D
Russian Santa and the Easter Kangaroo are bad-bottom! :P
WHERES JACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
Because until we saw the film we didn't know he was real, how would we have 
seen him in the trailer?
Invisible. Nobody believed in him.
they edited him out of this one because no one believed in him then the put 
him in the 2nd trailer 
Jack Frost is very cute! fangirl moment!!!!!
he has tatoos ''naughty'' and ''nice'' in his hands 
Jack Frost almost looks like Niall Horan from One Direction to me xD
Where are the crop circles??
Why is santa sounded like a russian 
is this a good movie to watch?
Haha, cool Russian frost.
Russian Santa, Asian (yeah, she's Asian) Tooth Fairy, Australian Bunny, A 
teenage Jack Frost. My life is a LIE!!! OMG I LOVED THE MOVIE!!!
the trailer with that music is so awesome it makes me want to cry...
Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeere is Jaaaaaaaack?!
Love, just love the nice and naughty tats :P
goddammit jack frost can get it anyday
Tooth is in the same place Jack was in the sleigh during the movie xD But 
in the movie she's actually not even riding it with them.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN SHOW JACK FROST!!!!!!! : O
My son, my husband, and I all LOVE this movie. We really hope they make a 
sequel.
for everyone asking, jack isn't in this trailer because most people didn't 
believe in him until the movie came out so they edited him out of this 
trailer and put him in the second. i'm a nerd, i know this stuff :p
The 2nd official trailer released later was Jack-centric. I think they kept 
him out of the 1st one since 'Jack Frost' wasn't really a big name compared 
to the other Guardians.
sooooooooo the gold flyer need a plane TO FLY?? xD

Muy buena..﻿
Once I had a dream.
I was getting a tour of a haunted mansion which was a hotel. Who was giving 
me the tour? A vampire. He opened a room and there was a skeleton, the 
skeleton was pretty embarresed. Another skeleton appeared, yelled something 
I don't remember, and threw something at the vampire.
Sound familiar?
Months later after that dream Hotel Transylvania came out.

So I mentioned this a while back and I think they may have managed to 
completely turn off a Gendy Tartakvosky product in just over a minute. I'm 
impressed and saddened.﻿
In *Hotel Translyvania* Sel had to some stunts. (Expand this post to read 
about it)

"We had a stunt driver come in and teach Ethan how to do 360-degree spins 
because he wanted to do all of it himself," Selena Gomez said. "First I 
wasn't in the car but then I got in and he was doing and I was like, 
'You've done this before in another movie, right?' and he said, 'No, this 
is my first time.' I was like, 'Great, so this is going to be where I die.'"

Fortunately, Sel escaped with just some little bruises. But, she smiled, "I 
actually wanted to get a few injuries so I could be like, 'Yeah, I've got 
battle scars from making an action movie.'"

*Watch the trailer of **Hotel Translyvania** below.*

Also, some of you are saying that this movie copied Twighlight, but it did 
not.  "They're so different," Sel said. "I didn't even think about that 
until people mentioned it today. I really didn't. This is way different". 
Even Sel said it wasn't like Twilight.

so nice! I wanna watch it :D﻿
"Hotel Transilvania" is (still) better than "Brave".
The character animation was one of the best I've seen, the plot was funny, 
the gags were many, only the story left me a bit 'unsatisfied'... but still 
I enjoyed it more than "Brave" (with such great contestors like this and 
"Wreck'it Ralph", I still don't understand why neither won the Oscar).
So, a good movie with great animation for all ages. Recommended! ﻿

After the Smurfs, here comes Tintin. The Adventures of Tintin Movie Trailer 
Official (HD)
Back to my childhood favorites....
Belgian culture in hot this year.﻿
Didn't realise that Rick Astley was staring in this film...﻿
I'm waiting for this movie. I've been a fan of Tin-Tin since childhood. I 
so look forward to it!﻿
Tin Tin﻿
excellent music from one of the catalogs we represent!﻿
Awesome! :D﻿
*Is Tintin ready to take over America?*

*Can a European tradition make its way to US?*

*Tintin was created in 1929 by Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi (aka Herge), 
the original comic strips were black and white and cranked out for a 
children's newspaper supplement that Remi edited (which may explain the 
rambling nature of some of the tales).* *Remi, himself unsure of how old 
Tintin was supposed to be, gave the character's age as roughly 13 or 14 at 
the start and a few years older by the end.* 
*From the Soviet Union and Shanghai to chasing a Chicago gangster into the 
fading American West, this Belgian kid has traveled all over the world and 
beyond (see: "Destination Moon").*
*Not only have the 23 adventures remained in print over the years, but the 
tales have been adapted before, as an animated TV show, a BBC radio 
adaptation, a pair of French live-action films and much more.* *But as cool 
as the new film looks in its behind-the-scenes motion-capture makings, it's 
hard to top Herge's simple drawings of a boy, his dog and his often-drunken 
pal traipsing through the jungles, the snowy mountains and the barren 
moonscape for adventure at its best.*﻿
For my bud +Yves Cooreman .﻿
:-)﻿
Tintin!﻿
OK, so it's been eight months. Missed it on release -- because it only 
lasted two weeks in the cinemas -- but finally just watched it, via iTunes. 
My only regret is that I rented it rather than buying, because this 
deserves to be seen again. Yes, I'm a long-time Tintin tragic, but this was 
brilliant. As with LOTR, this was a movie that could only be made by 
someone with a great love of the original, and the Spielberg/Jackson team 
have captured the spirit of Tintin superbly. Loved it. Can't  wait for the 
sequel.﻿
*Tintin In 3D*

Die hard fans will never be satisfied with a film adaptation of the classic 
Tintin graphic novels. More mature audiences will find the 3D movie 
charmingly dated and impatient for the sequel demanded after a rushed 
ending. Spielberg's action choreography dazzles in any media. Hopefully new 
young fans will be excited enough … to read the originals.

Check out this clever Herge biography told in the style of his graphic 
novels.

The Adventures of Tintin Movie Trailer Official (HD)﻿
An awesome movie and story, Tin Tin. My boys have loved reading the old 
books.﻿
interesting...﻿
C. & I both really enjoyed the Tin Tin movie. We watched in 2D (natch, not 
supporting the daft plot to make us watch in silly 3D) at our local 
independent cinema http://www.stationcinema.com/

Better than I expected it to be after reading some luke-warm reviews... it 
was actually rather good... a bit of an Indiana Jones romp... with some 
great action sequences. The digimation was clever and is scarily lifelike - 
although you don't get the charisma of a Harrison Ford coming through (er.. 
actually there's plenty of live action movies that suffer from not having a 
Harrison Ford in them!).

Definitely worth seeing - great for youngish kids - Charlie loved it.

Anyone else notice the end of the trailer spoils that the Mayor is the bad 
guy?﻿
Its either the Rambo or the Ranger﻿
is that mumford and sons I',m hearing?﻿
@spencemace haha LUL-zer !!!
what every you do do not look down.... *looks down* MAMAMIA!!!
nice to see Jonny Depp playing a nervous incompotent since his glory days 
of Sleepy Hollow and Corpse Bride
Great graphics
I don't think I will ever see a new animated film as good as Rango ever, 
not ne from Pixar. Rango is an cinematic achievement, a morality tale that 
plays eloquently as an existentialist reexamining of the works of Joseph 
Campbell Fucking brilliance 
lol this might actually be a awesome movie!
Ohh shut up!! If You don't like this movie then don't watch it ok! But 
don't come and critisize this animation movie,it's great!!
click like for this if u watch this in 2013
it seems like a intersting movie
@apadig Just i always wished ;)
classic collection
zzzzzzzzzzz 
could be good...
The trailer was pretty long, and this one was shown in theaters, so my 
assumption is that the film itself will be longer. That's kind of how 
things have worked, I've noticed in the past few years. film is avalilable 
even on sitemoovis.co.cc by the way.
lol 1:09
why did rango kill the bird? she was just hungry.
Just finished watching it, nothing funny, not very interesting but there 
must be a signification, some hidden meaning. Jonny Depp admited in an 
interview being demon possessed in order for him to do the acting properly. 
In the movie there is a serpent talking about taking souls, ''who controlls 
water, controlls everything''/same with food. I don't have much knowledge 
on illuminati, the real and hidden world rullers but there is something 
fishy about it.
i saw the movie i laughed so hard it really kept me goin really really 
entertaining 
you are gonna save us right shes sooooooo cute when she says that
i am SO gonna watch this movie today !!!
@smileygirl823 thanks for the spoiler...............
@yoyorickboy17 if u seen the movie,it does fall down after a while
$$$$
Oh, bother. Sometimes we all feel a little hungry.﻿
I wish I could still see this in theaters :') i want to see it so bad
@AlwayysOriginal13 Omw! Me too! I thought I was the only one whose nursery 
was Winnie the Pooh. I am 23 years old , and I was named after this , you 
can probably guess it.
Friend: WHAT SHOULD WE WATCH? Me: IT DONT MATTER LONG AS WE WATCH WINNIE 
THE POOH
wow isnt that creepy " i can tell your going to be rather fisity today" is 
i just me or is that really creepy when said with pooh's peitofile voice?
"i can see your goign to be rather fisity today" oh god thats creepy!!
I teared up at 0:45 haha, and really teared up at 0:51 :( It was a big part 
of my childhood -heart sign- hah
@asdfqwertyfour In the film, its "Winnie the Pooh" on the book simply 
because in the original film it was also "Winnie the Pooh".
What is this song? its awesome
im 19 and i wanna see this!
i cryed at the end :) thumbs up if ya love pooh!
Why is everyone flipping a shit thinking this movie is aimed towards kids? 
"Is it bad that I'm [some age over 7] and what to see this movie?" Yeah? 
So? Doesn't mean shit. Did you guys see all the references they made to the 
old material? This is pure nostalgia fuel aimed towards the people who saw 
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
I loved the movie and Winnie the pooh!!!<3 what's the song called?
I already felt like crying just by watching the trailer :)
ok ill allways love Winnie the pooh, and glad theyve made this old school 
again!. But i dunno,.....some of the voices were messed up, Eeyore is way 
way waaaay to depressed and some of the parts just didnt seem like a Winnie 
the Pooh film! eg. if youve watched it then the part with rabbit tryna look 
for things..... Anyways its was OK =)
@FrayFan48 I'll never outgrow cartoons. After all, it's really just another 
word for animation.
i love how Christopher Robin is english!
@wilhelmryan2113 DUDE winnie the pooh is english -.- 
Finally, a Winnie the Pooh movie based off the novel.
I'm soon 22 but I still love Winnie the Pooh (^_^)
Your never too old
This used to be my favorite cartoon as a kid, I just got teary-eyed 
watching this....I'm an 18 year old guy too
" i can see your going to be rather fisty to day 
now that i got watching HP out of my system. Now i want to watch this one

I only saw this movie once. It was in Chinese(I am a total novice and had 
no idea what it was saying) and the English subtitles were awful, like once 
the "Shen Princess(The Peacock(Who I am pretty sure is male))" said 
something like "He too strong! You cannot control dead Korean!" I want to 
see it again but maybe in English. U.U 
UHSUME!!!!
also for playstation users type in kung fu panda full film & better results 
come up. as playstation does not have the software to watch it on well

I was really excited to see this movie because the birds were so awesome in 
the trailer and then I go to sit down and watch it and what do I get? 
Well.... let's just say I don't really care for this movie! I don't hate it 
by any means I just found it well disappointing.... you see they show the 
humans too often they should focus more on the birds and that's my biggest 
problem I have with this movie! Also let's just say that well, the human 
designs were not that great! I mean everyone is saying they were but this 
is my personal opinion you guys might have another one but I don't like the 
way they show the humans too much! The acting is a little silly... well 
let's just say that the acting in the movie was a little too overboard! I 
found the lady that owns blue or whatever his name is the blue bird let's 
just say that! Well I found her very ugly looking! I watched it until the 
villian bird was about to sing his song and then I had enough of the film! 
This movie was very boring, the humans were shown WAY too much! I thought 
they would be more like guest stars I mean if they didn't show the humans 
too much then I would call it an OK movie! But since they show them too 
often I'd call it a disappointing movie! Nothing in this film got me amused 
on one single bit of it! The film I was also really excited to see was Puss 
in Boots that year but it wasn't too disapointing I thought it would be 
cuter but oh well it's still pretty funny! But I didn't think this film 
would get any better because I thought it was very boring and not 
entertaining well that's my review on Rio! Hopefully the next film is way 
better!﻿
Yes, I can't fly, I pick my beak, & once in a while I pee in the birdbath﻿
Wow that is awesome

This is probably the best Christmas movie ever! It put me in the spirit I 
much needed for this season. I LOVE ARTHUR CHRISTMAS!!!﻿

terrible animation﻿
James Mcavoy <3 as the voice of Authur !! I love him ﻿
Bad animations ﻿
{ animation } Full trailer for Arthur Christmas made me say, "That sure is 
a movie!"﻿
Arthur Christmas, #movie , On DVD Now - Arthur Christmas http://ow.ly/2t48jg
﻿
Although my daughter found it a little too *unfluffy* for her six year old 
taste (probably not enough pink!), I really enjoyed *Arthur Christmas*. 
Further proof that *Aardman* may be taking the yankee dollar to get their 
stories made into films, but they certainly haven't sold their soul. For 
starters 'Trelew' actually looks like a small Cornish town, not a twee 
Americanised idea of one. There's a nice strand of very British humour 
running through the whole thing too and a host of fine voiceovers from the 
likes of Bill Nighy (a show-stealing turn as grumpy old 'Grand Santa'), Jim 
Broadbent, Hugh Laurie, Imelda Staunton, James Mcavoy and others.

Good festive fun that doesn't go overboard with the seasonal 
sentimentality.﻿
Um bom Filme de Natal ;)﻿
Arthur Christmas is The Must See movie of the holiday season! Soooo cute!!! 
Funny!!! Great great Movie! Don't miss it ♥﻿
The best Christmas film in recent years. Even better than Polar Express.﻿
Pains me to say it, but I found Arthur Christmas to be a surprisingly good 
festive film. This, despite me being a crotchety old git and it being the 
middle of November.﻿
I miss you Hannah Nichelle Dinoza! I haven't seen you for more than a week. 
Daddy can't wait to watch Arthur Christmas with you tonight. Lotsa love.﻿

The development of Cars 2 seems to have been driven as much by 
merchandising wants as creative needs. After all, it's easier to sell cars 
than Ed Asner. Wow I really liked this movie! It is worth seeing this in 
theaters but if you want you can see him online at getfilmsnow.co.cc.
"Cars 2" is as close to a pure boys' movie as the toon studio has yet made 
-- though all boys' movies should be so universal in appeal. Hope this is 
the best place for the movie lovers, crtkani.co.cc page!
With their more elegant diction, Caine and Mortimer provide a wonderful 
contrast as his formidable new allies. wow it looks really great already! 
I'm gonna watch whole movie today at filmsi.co.cc!
@lrrejr it did come out yesterday
I LOVE LOVE this cartoon. I think it's amazing. I loved it, finish it at 
°°free°cartoons°.°u°s (remove all °)
@Tacom4ster Is this a joke? You are a braindead sheep if you actually 
listen to critics. THINK FOR YOURSELF! Besides REAL Pixar fans enjoy every 
Pixar film for what it's worth, the online community enjoys bashing Cars 
and Cars 2 because it's some type of bandwagon. Please, don't call yourself 
a Pixar fan.
The whine of engines and the rattle of gunfire (surprisingly frequent in a 
G-rated film) compete with the nonstop yakking to such an extent that 
Michael Giacchino’s score has to strain and blare to be heard. have to 
believe what people said. This will be good film. Watch it on crtkani.co.cc
Larry's vocal turn lifts Mater to the pantheon of endearing Pixar creations 
even as he gets occasionally gets on the viewer's nerves, as he should. 
bout to watch this for free at filmsi.co.cc :) not spam btw its a f'ing 
awesome site.
@xiTzblazinx But that's what made it funny! If Lightning had ended up a 
spy, the story wouldn't have been interesting at all-cuz he'd probably know 
what he was doing. 
Wow you spamming noobs are idiots! Cars 2 wasn't a book before the movie! XD
just back from the cinema..... this movie is amaaaazing !!! i loved it :D 
“Cars 2” is certainly built to move merchandise — this series may surpass 
even the “Toy Story” films as an effective advertisement for licensed 
playthings — but it is notably lacking in soul or sublimity. Watch the 
movie in full version on crtkani.co.cc Excelent movie!
With its frequent nods to James Bond and other spy thrillers, the movie 
makes sure even the uninitiated will recognize the inspiration. The action 
scenes, of which there are several, are disappointingly pedestrian, doing 
little to raise the pulse. Wow, awsome film to watch it with your 
girlfriend at getfilmsnow.co.cc.
But they (Bonnie Hunt, Cheech Marin and the Pixar stalwart John 
Ratzenberger, among others) are very much in the background. Most of “Cars 
2” takes place far from Radiator Springs — in Tokyo, Paris and London — and 
Lightning’s racing exploits are secondary to the improbable adventures of 
Mater.im gona see it tomorrow at crtkani.co.cc. exellent film.
Little about Cars 2 feels fresh, and more fun seems to have been had coming 
up with character names than developing the story. I watched this movie few 
days ago at getfilmsnow.co.cc in great quality...
Pic allows the viewer to relax into a pleasurable groove even as its 
abundant in-jokes and peripheral details encourage the mind to stay 
actively engaged.I really liked this movie, don't really know what else to 
say. The directors and the cast did a great job. Just finished watching it. 
You can too watch it for free at crtkani.co.cc.
Handily demonstrating that the often-aggravating staples of so much 
kid-friendly animation -- nonstop banter, ethnic accents, goofy wordplay 
(mileage may vary), even bathroom humor -- can be executed with wit and 
class.At filmsi.co.cc is english version of this briliant film!
hmmm let's see, my fav movies(of this kind) are:: 1.Cars (1 and 2) 2.Toy 
Story (1,2,3) 3.Finding Nemo 4.Ratatouile(not sure if I wrote it right) you 
know the movie with that cook and his little mouse ?!
Usually, Pixar does an excellent job of representing emotion. In this case, 
however, it feels forced and the associated "message" is presented with a 
minimum of elegance (a speech about friends). BS, this movie is supposed to 
be watched in 3d. for me atleast :) Search it on getfilmsnow.co.cc.
Not a frame goes by where you can't hear Lasseter's inner child squealing 
with pleasure.Very nice movie, full at crtkani.co.cc, worth watchin more 
than once, belive me! Hilarious movie ever seen at crtkani.co.cc website. I 
really enjoyed in movie!
Wowww....Yes the visual effects are great and the action seems overwhelming 
but Pixar forgot one thing....ITS ABOUT LIGHTNING MCQUEEN AND NOT MATER..we 
all love Mater but for comic relief not to make the ENITRE film a comedy 
parade....WOWW PIXAR YOU FORGOT THAT KIDS FELL IN LOVE WITH MCQUEEN NOT 
MATER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! mcqueen is the reason i watched the first one...yes 
Mater was funny but Mcqueen was the FRESH, ARROGANT, INTERNALLY 
DYSFUNCTIONAL CHARACTER EVERYONE FELL IN LOVE WITH...

@Ellement90 too much "volence"

I just saw Toy Story 3 and it was absolutely amazing. By the end of it, I 
was crying as I remembered all the memories I've had growing up with Toy 
Story and as I thought to myself "Is this REALLY the last one?" :,( Toy 
Story will always live on in my heart. :,) 
Really Good Movie Go See It !

these movies, and NOW they make a sequel??? ...THANKYOU!
andy is so cute when he was young.he treats woody as his bro
@justafidemyself I kno this movie's gunna be awesome
lol buzz speaks spanish
@marz0o that's obvoiusly because since toy story 3 will take place 10 years 
after toy story 2, they'd obviuosly change at some point
Yes.
For Buzz who's been accidentally reverted to Spanish version, that's not 
good. Did Buzz hit something when he attempts to fly? And does he get put 
on English at the end?
some people already found the easter egg Buy n' Large batteries-----Wall-e
I LOVE TOY STORY!!!
@WolfLover995 lol! i didn't notice till now! :D
The tale of toy story is classic lots of people have seen it when they were

brings back memories when i was a kid...

: ) Me and my girlfriend chose this movie for our first date... Pixar, dont 
let us down :)!!

WHAT HAPPEND TO BOW OR THAT PINK LAMB GIRL TOY????

Amazing movie, but this trailer is just awful. This makes the movie look 
like a kiddie comedy, when in reality is pretty much the same style as 
Disney's previous musicals. It's misleading and stupid, same goes for the 
marketing they made with Frozen. (No, I haven't seen Frozen, but I've heard 
that's amazing and I really want to see it, but I don't like the 
commercials)﻿
why do they always put scenes in trailers that aren't in the movie?﻿
Frozen is shit compared to Tangled.

Just saying. My reasons behind this are that Pascal is a much better 
companion to have than Olaf as he tries to steal the glory from the main 
roles.﻿
This is my biography for real lol!:-) ﻿
so weird
i bacame interested in this kind of movies (walt disney) 
and also animated movies that will make u cry (Hayao Miyazaki) 
(Mamoru Hosoda) 

does it mean im gay? ﻿
tangled﻿
I love tangled more than frozen﻿
0:46 What song is that? PLZ let me know!﻿
♥♥♥Check out My Tangled Rapunzel Makeup Tutorial♥♥♥﻿
I ment pan﻿
واو﻿
I love how half of  this footage wasn't  in the movie.﻿
Google pictures: tangled anal sex﻿
I WANT A PART 2 :(﻿
god i love this movie!!!!!!!!!﻿
Always nice thats 
The movie﻿
best animated movie ever <3﻿
barely any of the scenes in this trailer are actually in the movie!﻿
Safygfhhtshhhqhqbqhgqgggqgqywgaaggagug﻿
cutie,.. :P﻿
The girl Rapunzel is deffently the most atractive girl i've ever seen﻿
the bit where rapunzle hitting Flynn with the boot and the fighting with 
the hair never happnd and when Flynn goes out the window on the chair never 
happnd﻿
this movie is so pantastic!﻿
Does anybody find it funny that there's a random frying panama in the 
middle of the storyline? Ha ha ha﻿
I never seen Tangled but I LOVED Frozen. It's liked my favorite Disney 
movie now.﻿
$$$$
OMG I cant believe am only seeing this now.﻿
10th movie:How to Train Your Dragon 2 with the voices of Jay Baruchel and 
Gerard Butler﻿
Guess what guys (and girls), im starting to feel that Astrid is the one 
that does all the romantic moves... x_x what do you think?﻿
Omg this looks so awesome﻿
When did hiccup suddenly get hot?﻿
Toothless is adorable!﻿
Great..... Another movie to make me want Toothless. D'X﻿
i dont get why they tell us so early. it creates too much suspense!﻿
dis gona be AWESOME﻿
Can't wait for this movie! <3﻿
June!?!?!?!?!?! Ain't nobody got time to wait!﻿
yes looks awesome .loved the first one
.its gonna be great﻿
This is going to be like shrek 2 or kung fu panda 2. Good sequels﻿
Cannot wait!﻿
You would had taught Hiccup would had a deeper voice...﻿
One of the movies (first part) that totally sucked in 3D but was awesome in 
2D.﻿
OMG OMG OMG OMG I AM SO WATCHING THIS!!! OMG HICCUP!! *melts* ﻿
wow... okay so the reveal in which we found out that the super creepy dude 
was actually Hiccup's mother would have been REALLY fun to been left 
unspoiled... >_>﻿
OMGG! I WANT TO WATCH THIS BADLYYY﻿
I hate to be that guy but I really wanted Nolan North from the TV show to 
take over as the voice of Stoick. Not that I don't mind Gerald Butler but 
he hasn't exactly been a big box office draw after 300. ﻿
This time... It's personal﻿
Does anyone except me thinks that Dreamworks makes better films than Disney 
now days?
If you think about it Astrid & Hiccup probably beats most Disney couples, 
hiccup lost his leg and there are certainly some deaths in How to train 
your dragon 2﻿
I can't decide between this or Rio 2 to watch?﻿
OMG, was Astrid braiding Hiccup's hair?! Pause at the first millisecond of 
the scene and you can actually see her right hand (the one placed on 
Hiccup's chest) holding on the braid!! Wonder where she gets the string for 
the braid!! Ps.love Astrid's hairstyle-
Blonde and Braided Tail?! Yeseseseseses!!﻿
The first move is the best i have seen..cannot wait for the movie 2﻿

Amazing movie. It deservers more views!

WH 40K the Movie........................﻿
I f*cking loved this and I hope they do more.﻿
that's because you're not a true fan at all, stick to your pc games son and 
leave true fans to enjoy this :) 
I'm watching this movie right now I do have to say the cgi is some what bad 
but I would give it a go
This actually looks pretty damn good and everyone who says it's crappy IS A 
HERETIC AND SHOUDL BE BURNED!
primusdeathstar is a heretic. Glory to the first among us who illuminates 
him.
horrible CGI - I've seen it - the whole thing is weaksauce to say the very 
least. Go play ultramarine - its better in every respect.
meh looks budget 
How did they get john hurt?
Looks like about 90 minutes of bad cg smashing into one another with very 
little explanation as to why. I'ma just play the game while watching reboot
This movie was so damn good loved the whole thing 
not sure where you got that but it this isn't fan made. this was an 
official movie which got GWs approval. the lord inquisitor is a fan made 
movie and a lot better
ah this is just a cartoon, I had been hoping for a real movie
The games had better animation quality
This movie could have been so much better. I felt like I wat watching the 
shitty CGI clone wars reboot. The only thing PG-13 about this movie was the 
occasional drop of blood, such a waste of time.
This film made me want to renounce the Emprah :|
how do you find the taint of evil? Look for the junk and head south, if you 
see a dark smelly hole you've gone too far. 
So long as Ollanius Pius and the Battle of Terra are in it.
:D
Nice point.
Only it's not fan made. Stop spreading false information heretic.
Great voice cast!
where are you getting your facts? when people say 'fanmade film' they 
usually refer to a bunch of fans getting together and making a movie but it 
was independently created and produced by companies. The animation is 
flawed for our current time, and I mean severely flawed. They would have 
honestly been better off doing it live action with special effects.
$$$$
The best movie ever!!! I loved all the characters.. GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW 
IF YOU DIDN'T YET!! GO!!﻿
May 29th is my birthday :D﻿
I'm watching this now!

Is your child turning 18, graduating? Feeling nostalgic about parenting. It

*Sony Pictures Acquiring Rights to a Movie About Steve Jobs?*
There is only one movie about the life of Steve Jobs I would love to see, 
and it is made by *Pixar*, the animation company Steve Jobs bought from 
George Lucas back in the day. I really hope Pixar will do that in the near 
future. There are powerful lessons to be learned from the life of Steve 
Jobs -- a Pixar movie would appeal to and inspire both kids & adults alike. 

*What do you think?*

I attached a trailer of Pixar's last true masterpiece, UP!﻿
Only Disney/Pixar films can reduce people (including grown men) to tears! 
they practically had me bawling by the end of the movie! There has to be 
something wrong with your tearducts if you dont feel a little teary eyed by 
the end of the film!
with my wilderness explorer GPS we'll never get lost........ ooooooopssss 
ROFL...
77 dislikers doesn't like the dog!!! 
@RandomKid396 Are you Ted? :) Admit it!

Great movie!!!
@niginai haha it is funny because the squirrel gets dead
I cry on pixar films :L
smosh version: "so long boys!!! pfffffffffffft!" *throws balloons into the 
sky but nothing happens
i just finish watching it.. i tried not to cry.. :(
This film gets really sad when the sof piano music is played and Ellie 
dies. I'm not gonna lie, I shed a few tears in the cinema >.<
The preview of this doesn't show how good this movie is. At first I didn't 
think it looked good, but when I watched it, it was a masterpiece.
i cried so many times. this is an amazing movie. the beginning killed me.
Pixar is the best.
I was hiding under your porch because I love you :D
this movie is a trip, for real
79 people cryed in the cinema Poor guys :(
1st time iv'e cried in a long time..
@ShaManTian He's Teddy Westside!
@bigdaddyfranchise there was a similar scene in inception: a house in the

general...

3000th comment! Anyway this movie is sooooo awsome/scary, I love how it 
follows that ''It's too good to be true'' and how it showes that there is a 
thin line beetween dreams and nightmares!﻿
This was my favorite and scariest younger childhood memory. ﻿
Don't watch this move baked out your mind this shit was tripping me out LOL 
scary ﻿
how is this movie for kids? this is so fucking scary﻿
I had nightmares for a month the first time I saw this! So awesome! ﻿
my fav movie!﻿
I agree such a creepy movie,don't watch the trailer before the movie it 
spoils everything!﻿
Gamato﻿
Ah I remembered watching this movie..... I don't understand how this is a 
kid movie.﻿
To be honest, if I had ever stumbled into a world where people had button 
for eyes, I'd run screaming back to the door shouting "AW HELL NAW!".
I don't care how good that world is.﻿
HOLY + BIBLE = Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth. Israel's GOD is

I would love a second movie but sadly that's impossible.﻿
coraline, she's so adorable :3﻿
tbh the trailer was a real turn off compared to the movie....because it 
made it seem like a family movie.....its not really one when you think 
about it...﻿
At 1:24, there are silhouette pictures of the other kids hang on the wall. 
Did anyone else notice that?﻿
I still remember watching tis when I was young... I normally don't get 
scared by movies but this?.... Damn I couldn't sleep﻿
I can watch horror movies and be completely fine, but THIS...this movie 
scared me so much!!! oh my gawd.﻿
Its not a movie for childrens >.< 
I saw this when i was 10 years old, i didn't sleep for like 3 months
It's like ALice in WonderLand but this Coraline in Dollhouseland. :v
This movie makes me see buttons in a different light. 
The book if f ing scary
This movie creeped me out for ages and i could never sleep in a bunk bed 
again and i was scared of my dolls!
Whenever this is on TV, one of the commercials are always La La Loopsy. It 
freaks me out ten times more than it already has.
eh??
$$$$
this was an adorable movie, completely like the classics we all love and 
miss, with a new cool concept of using a black princess 
instead....characters are lovable and helarious, its in 2-D and its 
definitely worth watching. five stars to the directors who should produce 
more disney films like these. they dont include any of the annoying back 
talk and bull tht u see in idiotic disney shows about teens falling in love 
with every other teen, disrespecting their parents and with retarded 
relatives.
what a movie..pls watch this in webmovietube
In my opinion, this was the last good non 3D disney movie!
I skipped Avatar to see this movie when it came out. I made the right 
choice. This brings me back to the day, reminds me of watching Disney VHS 
tapes at Nana's down in Boca, while they packed for the 2 hr. drive to WDW, 
as they lived near it so it wasn't far.
I watched this twice in Star Movies. AWSM !
@qwe09tube she looked like a bad person but you are right
I hope this wasnt the last 2D disney movie. Hope they make more cuz its the 
2D cartoons that made disney so lovable. without this movie I think most 
people would have forgot what disney was really about.
@blingblingshineshine Cause it'd be like 10 minutes long? They twisted it 
to actually add more to the story. Plus for once we see an actual 
developing relationship between the two main characters.
@inufan330 because the spell was over that time? or because else she's a 
princess too right
LOVE THIS MOVIE IT KICKS THE REST OF PRINCESS MOVIES' BUTT!
I just came home and I will viewthis cartoon right now on cartoonsi.co.cc. 
Manny people told me is great!
@AwakeningtoMe Probably because she's black. Maybe they wanted to make her 
look the least like a stereotype.
It seemed as it was yesterday when my girlfriend and I went to watch this 
in the movies sometime in January 2010. I loved this film/cartoon more than 
she did, Unfortunately things didn't work out between us but I'm glad I 
went to watch it with her. It brings back good memories and I am thankful i 
have them.
guys your favorite cartoons are now present at cartoonsi.co.cc waiting for 
you....just check them out at their best quality inthe site....log on now.!
''Unless you beg for mooore'' HAHAHAH, kills me every time.
I cried nostalgic tears.
Is it just me, or is that frog totally ripped out of "The Swan Princess"? 
Animation, mannerisms, etc?
why did disney break the princess steriotype?
this is REAL disney!! a classic disney movie again, i have seen this movie 
like 20 times and I still feel chills when watching it or when watching the 
trailer... go on disney!!!
what i love the most in this film ist the context (vodoo, working class..) 
and the jazz references (well is New Orleans) <3. love this film :D

does anyone know the name of the song / theme tune at the start?!
CHA! I saw this movie twice and loved it immediately!
This movie was better than the trailer makes us expect
$$$$
1... 2... 3-4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 
What's next again?﻿
Even though its been almost 5 years since its release, I still love this 
movie. all too often people look at the cover of the movie and say that its 
a stupid kids movie, when, yes, kids can watch it, but it gets extremely 
dark in some areas, and has more death and darkness in it than most major 
adult movies. Not to mention the music...OMG THE MUSIC﻿
....i only saw the end........ but this looks bad ass oh my god.......﻿
I have the special edition of the movie :3﻿
Pg-13? I loved this movie when I was 8 oops.﻿
I love this movie so much, but its so sad :'(﻿
is it called 9 cause there 9 off them because watching the trailer didn't 
answer my question of why is call 9 and do i want to watch it﻿
I have seen 9 twice I think. ﻿
I didn't understand this movie because I was littler.﻿
I do like some parts of this movie, and I like the concept. But  it had a 
LOT of  hype built up to it and the characters needed a bit more 
development.  Still enjoyable though.﻿
I just watched this movie. Just finished it like 10 minutes ago.
And I have to say, it was pretty good. Though, this trailer is basically 
the whole movie. Lol.﻿
9: 5th ANNIVERSARY is coming MAY 9 2014﻿
This movie is totally awesome, too short though, but this trailer was 
awesome so I had to watch it.﻿
Great film, it's a pity it is short though, i wanna see more of this world﻿
The song of this trailer is the WWE NXT Theme﻿
The song was not wwe it was welcome home by choheed and cambria ﻿
why m i keep coming to watch the trailer after i watched the movie , creepy 
!!!﻿
This movie is one of the more interesting movies ive seen, i think its 
worth the watch, in fact im watching it right now. I like the steam punk 
theme in the gritty post-apocalyptic Earth. ﻿
Not recommended﻿
This movie sucked﻿
It's weird....... The entire human race couldn't survive the robots, but 
the robots couldn't survive....... 9 rag dolls. O.o﻿
- "What happens next?" 
- "I'm not sure, exactly. But this world is ours now. It's what we make of

This trailer is freakin' epic!

Astro kinda reminds me of Gon from hunter x hunter﻿

conclusion i dunny why...﻿
This is a category for the 2009 AstroBoy movie. When this came out, a lot 
of  young Americans (around 3 to 25 years old) probably didn't know who 
AstroBoy was. Anyway, I'm not crazy about this movie. I would've prefered a 
voice that sounded a little younger. But AstroBoy was still cute. I just 
hate the way they made Dr. O'Shay look. XD

In this category, you can discuss this movie only and share videos of your 
favorite parts. You can also show other's fan art. Your own fan art belongs 
in the Fan Art and Comics category, but if it is specifically for the movie 
and you feel you really need to, then you may.
Here is the trailer for the movie:﻿
Jajajajaja I love Astro﻿
I KNOW! and im a guy....I don't care, this movie was underrated!!! soooo 
underrated!!!!
This film was okay, but If Pixar or Dreamworks made it, I bet it would've 
been better!!!
is this thing on?
This film reminds me of iron man. Iron man had to have a special power 
source I'n his chest like Astro boy. And had to fight a bog angry robot
Thnx man I found it on freeYcartoonsY. uYs, it is free! Remember to remove 
Y)
totally throws me off when they use recognizable celebrities as voice 
actors - I keep thinking of the other movies I know them from :-/
Anyone else think Astro Boy looks kinda like Wilbur from Meet the Robinsons?
Osamu Tezuka will always be the greatest when it comes to Astro Boy. This 
is just riding on the fame.

I personally prefer the first one instead of the second movie.﻿
I don't suggest watching this while stoned. You may find yourself raiding

It would be really really messy if this actually happened!  :P﻿
The Trailer is a Success﻿
The fat mayor l﻿
Just finished watching with little brother! loved it lol...﻿
No school!!
This one was amazing, it's just that I wonder if the 2nd out will be any 
better. The idea of leftover monsters was a great idea, it's just the way 
they planned out the rest of the movie...I don't know.
I made a huge mistake watching this movie while I was on a diet :/
I can't be the only one who thinks that Flint Lockwood and Rintaro Okabe 
look REALLY similar.
this has to be one of the greatest movies ever made!! 
IKR! It's also in the original book by Judi Barett :) Sort of . . .
That food song they used in Ice Age 2 was playing in the background near 
the end of the trailer.
You're telling me...my stomache is growling like never before.
Whats the name of That song and artist at 1:41
i wonder why didnt get rats ands bug XD
I heard the first trailer for Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs 2 and the

@randomvideowatcher I love you.
I don't like this trailer..... I mean the movie's one of my favorites just 
this trailer.... it's kind of ordinary. I don't even know
Strangely i liked this movie. It sure does have an absurd plot, but well 
developed

Well, this movie's hopes to be really successful were based on comedy. 
That's it. The story is ridiculous, there's no moral in the end. But to be 
fair, it did have few good jokes and the voice acting is okay, but apart 
from that... meh.... -_-
wtf? my friend told me that it was a good horror movie
$$$$
The best Ice Age imo. The 4th installment is very good too. Look forward to

that one guy reminds me of david bowie 
is the english dub any good? this trailer looks irresistable though XD
Off course, when nature gets screwed up leave it up to a five year old to 
save everyone:)
it's sosuke
i liked this movie i have it
All Disney did was dubb the movie. They didn't make anything.
Miyazaki's movies are just simply irrisistable :)
the dub was bad but noah actually made better. ponyo is really cute but 
creeps out my sister.
This movie is so relentlessly endearing. I will admit to tearing up with 
happiness at the end.
i have to say Noah did a VERY good job voicing Ponyo but did a terrible job 
with saying what Ponyo actually said but Frankie did a HORRIBLE job with 
everything.
japanese anime so awesome..their fantasy,,idea,so brilliant.
I watched this movie for the first time in english just a couple of days 
ago and i really enjoyed it. to all you nay sayers out there, shut up! 
seriously. Im sick and tired of all the people who hate english dubs, just 
like Japanese voice actors, American voice actors also work very hard to 
bring us stuff like this.
Frankie Jonas and Noah Cyrus! I really don't think Disney could have picked 
worse voice actors! Typical! Hope they haven't wrecked it :/
Frankie was great! :) Odd too hear myself saying that... 0_o
i'm not angry at disney for dubbing this video because without them i 
wouldn't be able to enjoy this movie. miyazaki is amazing at what he does 
and i love his movies, and without disney i wouldn't be able to enjoy them.
ponyo is soo much cuter in Japanese noah's voice ruins her adorbleness cute 
movie though! if you havent seen it you must!
i seen this in Japanese with subtitles. it was AWESOME!
if its from the makers of spirited away it MUST be good
ponyo ponyo ponyo fishy in the sea
his name is actually souske
This movie was adorable. :]

I know this story. You join up for all the right reasons and realize that 
what you are actually doing is retarded. And painful. And sad. You stood 
there up front and thought that there has to be a better way. Who knows...﻿
thanks for uploading hd version
looks cool
$$$$
None

OMFG... OMFG!!!!!!!!!! I BEEN LOOKING FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!! BUT I CAN'T 
FIGURE OUT THE TITLE!!!! AND I HAVE FOUND IT!!!!!!! OMFG!!!! THANK YOU 
THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!!!
Awesome
everyone should see this movie!
@derBene michel Ocelot's movies have always this design. See Kirikou, it's 
the same drawing. There is a lot of poesy in all of that (excuse my 
english, I'm french !)
@mistigri56 No need to FGod....
I know its the best film ever!!
It is far more enjoyable in its original languages.
im watching this in class XD
I watched this movie today, and absoloutly LOVED it <33 Gotta buy it now D:
the truth how men are
i did NOT care for the animation in this. just plane ugly
Wow, this is one stiff and cheap looking movie. And what's with the weird 
mix of paper cut animation and not stylized faces? Maybe the story's good 
but the look will make me avoid this movie.
best movie ever!!! 
Beautiful? Gorgeous? More like hideous, I guess.
$$$$
I love the movie and the dog but don't you think that the movie would be 
better without rino???
i loved the kitty^^
If they made a Beverly Hills Chihuahua 2, they can make a Bolt 2, right? 
Thumbs up if u want a Bolt 2!!! :D
omg lol ;p, "We need a fast set of wheels." "Heheheehem! I'll go get my 
ball."
Rhino is epic!
2:22 bolt title sign in abit u hear rihno the rat or mouse say coming!
I love Bolt it was a good movie, mittens and rhino rock too LoL Anyone know 
that Miley currently has a white german sheperd they kinda resemble Penny 
and Bolt so cool :)
@SnowThatRains I think that is a Elvis Presley song
@HannahBoltForever, boly looks cute when he makes the sad face. do it 
again. boly 2! Also, if they made a cars 2, they can make a bolt 2, or Bolt 
The revenge of the green eyed man or Bolt: The final challenge or something 
cool like that.
BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!
"The Road will be rough." "I have a ball." "Easy won't be part of the 
equation." "Promise?!" "Danger at every turn." "I eat danger for 
breakfast." "Are you hungry?" "STARVING!"
yeah, I didnt like Rhino too much, He was annoying. XD
i love the pigeon part LOL
2:17, omg those eyes are so adorible.
omg rinos awesome how can you not like him???
Which character is Miley Cirus? And what does Mittens actually say at 1:13??
for some reason, Penny's character reminds me Ellen Page :)
John Travolta was BRILLIANT.
bolt and mittens and rhino are so much like me and my two besties that we 
all started calling each other by their character names ^_^
He he he he he heeee 'I'll get my ball' that made me chuckle
Bolt was a sweet movie Rhino was the best!
I watched it and it got me thinking what would bolt and mittens kids look 
like?
this played young, but it was a fun movie for sure. 
I love the pigeon scene, its awesome
Love this movie :)

about. And how did I found this - Googled the same words *movie where

:17 Why'd they give her butt so much jiggle?...It's kinda turning me on.
haha! the penguins r the best
79 people didnt call first
Her name is Gloria!
Anyone who actually thinks this is BETTER than the first one is full of 
crap, and that's not just my opinion. At least the first one had an 
ORIGINAL plot. This one? Well, the main lion character has a dad who is 
leader of the pride. There's another lion who also wants to be leader. He 
ends up becoming leader and banishing the main protagonist. Then the place 
dries up and everyone starts criticizing him. SOUND FAMILIAR?

news is.. it`s a crash landing" *plane falls*
