I don't like movies but on a birthday party, I watched this on 1am and it 
was a cool feeling! Recommend! =)﻿
In the 1960's Satanic Leader Anton Lavey designed sophisticated programs 
that linked 3D objects with our world: Entities created and projected using 
satellite technology. Many experiments were done, but only at his choosing.﻿

I am one in a million: 
woman gets hit in the face with a door: i start laughing﻿
This trailer spoiled the scary scenes :(﻿
Omg﻿
So did this thing happen in the real story ?﻿
Very good and fun movie. Didn't like the ending -_-﻿
Scariest movie I've ever seen!!!﻿
2:40 O.M.G ﻿
Where can i watch the full movie?﻿
omfg goose bumps all over﻿
I saw the movie. It was beyond scary and amazing. The part I don't 
understand is the beginning. You could of started it with Bathseba Thayer 
cursing the acres of land. But instead the people who made the movie 
decided to put a bunch of teenagers or young males and females talking to 
somebody. The part that I find most disturbing is the hide and seek scene. 
Poor woman almost died.﻿
👏👏👏😳﻿
$$$$
Anyone else looking up these trailers from Netflix??lol ﻿
Looks just like Frailty. ﻿
Anybody seen this yet? I liked the Mexican original, and the US "remake" is 
clearly so substantially changed it may as well not be called that. So 
that's interesting. Plus, I liked *Stake Land*, Mickle's last movie. 

I think I remember +Orrin Grey mentioning this a few months back...﻿
I tried to watch this.  I'm a patient viewer, as most horror movies take 
30-40 minutes to really take off, but after 50 minutes I was too bored to 
finish it (rare for me not to finish a movie).﻿
Has anyone seen this? *We Are What We Are*. A remake of a Mexican 2010 
horror film with a few variations on the original,which just had way too 
much female exploitation for my liking.This American version is not bad per 
se, and certainly a very different and almost "quiet" take on the cannibal 
genre.It takes its sweet time getting interesting though.Dare I say it's a 
character study? Ah well, it's nice to see Kelly McGillis at least.

@Rick T...People are just giving their opinion of the movie. Who are you 
the GD youtube police?﻿
White people cray!﻿
It's been a long time since I've been traumatized by a movie, but the end 
of this one made me sick to my stomach and traumatized, which in part is a 
good thing because it's really outside of the norm and really bold. Great 
movie, but like I said, traumatizing.﻿
﻿
donde la puedo ver ﻿
This is a must see movie!﻿
"....and what we are is an illusion.   We love how it feels putting on 
heels, causing confusion."﻿
I was eating chili while watching this and that soup part kind of ruined 
it.﻿
I've seen literally thousands of horror and Gore flicks, I really dug the 
ending best I've seen in a minute.﻿
amber chylders should get a razzie award for her acting. she is sooo bad. 
the same expressionless face in every scene. felt like slapping her face.﻿
I haven't seen it or anything but I'm pretty sure they eat their victoms... 
Trailer says it all﻿
Very gory at the end﻿
OMG this is soo fetch. ﻿
I'm a bit intrigued since after I saw the original I thought it was a good 
horror movie concept but had vast room for improvement.﻿
The premise seemed interesting, but the trailer looks boring as hell. Is 
this movie boring?  ﻿
A MUST SEE!! ﻿
watch it for the end .﻿
  A great movie. However it will only appeal to those with an attention 
span longer than 10 seconds. This is a very intellectual film, unlike most 
modern horror fare that is written for the lowest common denominator 
(idiots). ﻿
Meh. Could honestly take it or leave it. The movie was incredibly boring 
for the most part- up until the end, that is. Still, I wouldn't recommend 
it. Sorry.﻿

You know there are killers running around the house why not just leave the 
house? Get your family,get some things you need like food and water and 
stuff and get the hell out of there and keep driving until you're far 
enough away that they won't know where to begin looking. My family would do 
that come on.﻿
Martin Garrix - Animals﻿
Am I the only one that thinks this is FUNNY! I mean..a horror movie where 
people where animal mask..hahahaha. like..why ANIMAL MASK haha﻿
This movie is proof that a kick ass Final Girl can elevate a rather 
mediocre home invasion movie to really good one. The Purge writers need to 
take notes. ﻿
Sharni Vinson is amazing in this by the way. Looking forward to seeing her 
in a possible Part 2 or other movies!﻿
some good murders, good masks, BUT really stupid stupid writing.﻿
I loved it!! Really good ending, I thought.﻿
I love it.. No complaints.. Even though it was very serious there was a 
good few one liners, which made it more real, I could see siblings bitching 
about things the way these did even in a time like that.. I loved that when 
she killed someone she made sure they didn't get back up like most people 
do when they're killing someone.. First film I've watched in a while were I 
do not have one complaint..﻿
i didnt like it :/
the story is good but i guess i was expecting something different﻿
Liberty I agree with u but in my country you HAVE to have proof on a camera 
otherwise the cops will think you killed him outside and dragged his body 
inside﻿
Those idiots below asking why there aren't internet. It's their parent's 
house damn it. Meaning it's old.. Plot is good!﻿
Just watched it, AWESOME movie! And great ending﻿
Trailer is so sick, a few things the movie could've done better kind of 
STARE YOU INT HE FACE, basic horror/tension stuff, like showing the guys 
take off the masks and one basically dying from the get go﻿
Not really. Only similar thing is that it's a home invasion involving 
masked killers
Well obviously, it's a horror movie....
RIP Lou Reed :(
the name of the song 1:30 please
Aguanta..!
Dosen't mater...
Who needs sleep anyways???
martin garrix - animals anyone?
This movie was bad ass ,
there is death and animal masks, those are the only real similarities
si quieren ver terror de verdad pongan en youtube esto : obedece a la morza 
es una pelicula del año 1983 , pues comienza con una figura cantando y de 
ahi habra cosas pores , pero al ultimo tienen que oir el mensaje , pero lo 
tienen que oir muy bien , otros dicen que nos advierte de algo nadie sabe 
de que , si lo vistes comenta para ti que oistes y lo especificas bien ,, 
espero tengan buenas noches ;)
I loved this movie... it was very well done and so much better than those 
other "we're trapped in this house because people are trying to kill us" 
movies... You can't compare it to The Collector, because they are very 
different, but I see why people might say that... Definitely a new favorite 
for me 3:)

Matilda gone bad??﻿
Uh... Carrie in elementary school. How many more versions of Carrie we have 
to ignore until the so-called directors are inspired to look up the words: 
"originality" , "creativity" "not tedious" etc :)﻿
worst movie ever !﻿
about to watch this. anyone seen it? +Andy Torres ?
#movies  +Hollie Carter the Bday girl. :) ﻿
Wow this movie looks so good﻿
one i am going to see﻿
I was going to watch this movie, then i saw this trailer and then I thought 
to myself "What horrible acting..."... so yea.... Definitely not seeing 
this﻿
This was the dumbest movie EVER. ﻿
Damn. Got some Carrie White shit.﻿
We just Netflixed this movie the other night and HATED it. It's one of 
those, coulda been good but wasn't movies. It leaves you feeling robbed of 
the time you invested.﻿
It was a great film ...and nothing like carrie..acting is great ...dumb 
idiots won't like it as there's no tits ...jog on little boys this is not 
for your tinys !﻿
Basically another Carrie﻿
Nothing to see here, moving along﻿
Good movie. Main girl actress is incredible. ﻿
In some parts this little girl reminded me of Natalie Dormer soo soo much 
 that I googled if this was her daughter or something :P﻿
she´s not possessed nor scary just a traumatized child seeking 
revenge....just in the wrong way...
the movie was ok but I think it was missing something im not sure what.﻿
Wtf it starts out like Carrie then turns into Children of the Corn?﻿
wuuuuut lol﻿
ive seen this film she gets herpes then eats some corn flakes then goes 
back in time poops on a dinosaur laughs then comes back robs frodo sells 
the ring uses money to buy nuke bomb then eats it farts then shits on gizmo 
then replaces her hands for dildos then slaps a donkey (for some weird 
reason) theeeeen she shouts MUKAKAKKAKA then she dies then gets 
reincarnated as a banana slug then lives happily ever after.......MEH  ﻿
the conjuring is way better than this movie﻿
Complete garbage. The main character is an annoying little brat who cries 
about everything and murders the people that try to help her, all for 
unexplainable reasons. Don't waste your time on this shit.﻿
let me guess it turns out shes just crazy and isnt actually moving things 
with her mind, she just killed her family?﻿
Carrie the beginning ﻿
This movie really touches you deep..About child abuse..I think it was 
great.﻿
$$$$
why'd they edit it so they say NO to great plains of africa? would of saved 
time just to leave it as yes,....﻿
Just read the book...﻿
This movie was so much better then the Crazies.﻿
28 weeks later watered down rip off.﻿
i liked this movie , it could of been better but it was good movie ﻿
Obligatory 'Inception' BWAAS!


BWAA!


BWAA!


BWAA!﻿
Those dont look like zombies...﻿
I only found out this was a zombie movie from the comments because uhm.... 
I never even seen one zombie? ﻿
The same people that thought this movie sucked are probably the same people 
that thought "You're Next" was actually good.﻿
If this movie was rated R it would be so much better.﻿
I think the South Park version was better :D
"Fuuuck yoou Brad Pitt! Fuuuuck yoooou!"﻿
This was an awful film, no character development, little thought went into 
details ( at one point Pitt is wearing a scarf -.-) Infact I had no 
connection to any one. The only amazing thing about the film was the cgi 
and size of the film. The story line doesn't even make sense, it was fun to 
watch with other people just to laugh at how stupid it was. I can't believe 
they wasted millions on this :( They should have just made The last of us 
(AMAZING STORY) into a film. That would be some thing worth watching. Story 
> Action scenes﻿
dady is so cooool﻿
got it free from Library - was worse than I thought, dont waste your time

and why does Pitt get an unattractive wife?﻿
2:09 PS4 Day one﻿
2:09 Take a look at the amount of people that hates Israel so much... SO

are those zombies?﻿
Loved the Movie! Much better than the typical crap.﻿
huuuh perhaps it is...
read the book it is nine hundred times better

Loved it
i like this...

helloooooo﻿
MAST SI.﻿
NEED TO WATCH NOW!﻿
not watching this alone
is alice in wonderland in this?
1:34 was the dude raping the old lady? 
nice 
... only for Park Chan-Wook!
2nd! 
LOL. why is her name India? >.<
if you are familiar with the director park chan-wooks and his great works 
like Joint Security Area, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, Oldboy, Sympathy for 
Lady Vengeance then the actress, cast or the crew doesnt matter. you can be 
assured that it is going to be an awesome
Piano Duet, from Philip Glass, you can find it on the soundtrack for the 
film. However, the music at end is not that one, probably is one Glass 
composed when he was attached to scoring the movie.
one of the best directed movie eveeeeeeeeeeer! loved it! 
Everyone had didffer
totally disagree
I cant wait
can you tell me what this movie is about? this trailer doesn't really 
explaine
Nicole Kidman is amazing: She's the only actress I know of who can say her 
dialogue without moving a muscle in her face 00:24 You can also see her 
amazing talent for this in Baz Lurhman's Australia 
ooooooh Matthew Goodeeeee!!!!!!!!!!!!
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK YEAH!!!
Best movie everrr
UNDERrated?? She has three Oscar Nomination!
someone tell me if this movie is good....i want to go see it.
SpongeBob lol? That bad huh.
why am i just now finding out about this film!!!!!!!!!!
$$$$
Remember when Sean Young had a career?﻿
Oh great...the next emerging trend...backwater inbreds.
Thanks duck dynasty...﻿
Saw that girl in a movie called "The Woman", where she played a pregnant 
girl in distress. Big career jump here.﻿
So this movie is about the jug or the pit?﻿
The worst movie ever, sorry, it's true...﻿
This movie trailer makes no sense. I am going to pass watching this. Also 
looks boring but this opinion is solely based on trailer, so i have no idea 
what actually happens.﻿
just another movie about a ketchup factory failing on the market... yea, 
right﻿
Daydreaming that the two men were John C Reilly and Will Ferrell, and it 
was a comedy. Can I give it a thumbs up on that basis? ﻿
lol jug face :)﻿
What???﻿
so what is this movie about exactly... i dont really get it﻿
HAHA 1:37 bitch got fucked up! ﻿
Just watched it.  Surprisingly good movie.  All of you talking smack about 
it, I'm wondering if you've actually watched the damn film.﻿
Trailer needs more fading transitions... lol...﻿
My mom's friend from high school is the director of this movie﻿
It looks like Shaun from Heavy Rain LOL﻿
Soooooooo... She's the jug? Or a pit? Did a schizophrenic cut this trailer?﻿
instead of bringing out this movie they should of filled the fucking hole 
in...... the end﻿
lol some backwater hick town 10km from the reset of society idolizing some 
jug under some trash moonshine 100 year old tradition. Im surpisred it's 
not based on a true story #whiteamerica ﻿
lol I guess at the end of the movie she made things "right" by sacrificing 
herself to the pit then I suppose everything went back to "normal" 
afterwards.﻿
BAD movie though i havent seen it yet...﻿
0:46 ozil , is that you ?﻿
I looked it up: "JUG FACE tells the story of a pregnant teen trying to 
escape a backwoods community when she discovers that she may be sacrificed 
to a mysterious pit. The entity in the pit requires a life for keeping the 
community safe. The face of the person to be sacrificed is crafted onto a 
ceramic jug. When ignored, the entity unleashes an evil onto the community. 
Now no one is safe as tragedy befalls each member one by one and they soon 
realize that the pit wants what it wants."﻿
Pit, not pig.
Jug Face iwantmovies.info

and might i add no bruce campbell not evil dead﻿
It's not scary, well if you're female it probably is (not being sexist, 
we're just men we are resilient against horror) but it's actually very good 
and under-scored in reviews I see.﻿
It's not scary , but 100 times better then the original ﻿
One of my favourite horror movies!﻿
You know i thought the same as te rest. This movie aint gon be shit. Is 
what i told myself. I watched it. Entertaining nonetheless but the scares 
didnt come then. They came the next day when suddenly i thought my family 
would turn against me and try some shit. For 3 days i was paranoid to a 
whole new level﻿
This was the scariest movie I've ever seen. The only way any movie is scary 
of course is if you have a huge screen and surround sound blasting to get 
the full experience, otherwise every horror movie is garbage.﻿
Lol why is it always with girls in a white gown and black hair dripping 
down her forehead xD﻿
I don't wanna be offensive, but who will stupid enough to live in a house 
in the middle of nowhere?-.-﻿
ahhhhhhh﻿
i got out of the movie theaters after 20 minutes :D ﻿
great movie like this is now hard to find.. ﻿
Comparing the original and comparing this is like comparing a tomato and 
and a apple. the original was a cheesy dark comedy while this was strictly 
horror. I like both because of there differences. and BTW ash wasn't in 
this movie because  he's in  the army of darkness 2 which I guess its a 
separated franchise now.﻿
This is one of my all time favorite horror movies! much better than the 
original too.﻿
Dont bother with this piece of shit remake!!! Watch the classics instead =) 
I hate it when People decide to try and resurrect a class A horror film, 
when they can't possibly do it justice! Remakes = shit!... Originals = good 
times! ;) ﻿
"EVIL DEAD" A MOVIE IN WITCH EVERY WOUND IS CURED WITH SILVER TAPE.﻿
I wanna see this film so bad ;) it may be scary and hardcore; but a perfect 
Halloween fright fest! If you ask me; I think Nicole Pedra would have been 
a better choice for Mia than Jane Levy... That's what I think :)﻿
looks scarier than the original﻿
could someone tell me a page to download this movie for free please?﻿
Just watched this for the 1st time last night since the opening night in 
Theaters and the demons sucks and this film sucks, i liked it the 1st time 
but last night i was just laughing, the characters are horrible, and i know 
Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell produced this but i dont like it, 
the original's are so much better, scarier, and more gory, cant beat the 
original﻿
One of the best horror movies ! ﻿
and my parents wonder why I hate cabins﻿
This was WAY better than the original . The Original had some dull scenes 
and some scenes almost made me shit my pants laughing. The only thing 
creepy about it was how fake everything looked. Neither film was scary & in 
Today's age people are able to make films really realistic so the Original 
really doesn't compare at all. I watched this Version before I watched the 
Original & in doing so this Version made the Original look like a Parody or 
a High School class project remake because of weird and fake alot of the 
scenes looked which is due to the time period the movie was made in. Just 
because there is a Remake of a Movie it doesn't automatically make the 
Original Film Better. I Guarantee if this Version was released first, 
people would be talking shit about the Original Film.  I hate old Films, 
the acting sucks, its not realistic & they have alot of dull parts. YES 
Hollywood copies them & although they might not always make them Scary I 
still like them because the Originals are not even Scary. The Exorcist is 
another Film that should be Remade because that was a Piece of Shit. Like 
Seriously that movie still holds Titles like "Scariest of all Time" maybe 
it was Scariest during ITS time due to the fact that there was nothing 
really like it but in Today's age I think that The Exorcist Gave a Great 
foundation for alot of Horror Movies out today & Hollywood has made the 
Idea even better in some movies even though I thought the Exorcist was 
shitty. Plus I had to watch it like 3 times because I kept falling asleep. 
Come to think of it No Horror movies had ever made me scared. The only 
Movie to scare me is Insidious. The Conjuring was also another Boring movie 
should of been made in 1980 or something. :DDDDDDDD﻿
LOL they are remaking the Trilogy?! ﻿
the conjuring guys watch it a almost ad a brown onion in my pants!﻿
Hard to believe this is a sequel to Army of Darkness, eh?﻿
$$$$
I loved this movie. It had scary moments, but I also cried like crazy.﻿
The conjuring is the scariest movie of all time﻿
This was such a dumbass movie.. They make the creature seem like it's going 
to be some demonic presence that'll scare the shit out of you, but it's 
just some stupid ass monster they made up that has fucking feelings. It was 
awful. ﻿
Scariest movie ever!!!!﻿
at least kids are not the products of incest﻿
watched this in my bed at night. sleeping in my moms room since.﻿
O shit good film HORROR is good :::::::::::::))))﻿
wow..!! ﻿
It's not even that scary, just sad and jumpy.﻿
I would give this movie a 2/10 for scaryness and a 7/10 for the plot. I 
watched this movie and it actually wasn't that scary. I was in the base 
ment at 12 at night (w/ my friend) it wasn't tht scary. ﻿
I'm watching this!

movie is really scary and cool but this trailer is bad XD ﻿
I thought it was a rlly good movie but it was sad﻿
Great movie! One of my favorites. I highly recommend this movie. ﻿
6\10 because of the effects cuz the film is a waste of time﻿
Such a bad movie, not worth the watch at all.﻿
This movie made me cry…it's not scary it's just spooky and sad. It's like 
"The Lovely Bones".  I'm still crying…...﻿

i wish Rob Zombie did this :D
Am I the only one who thinks Horror And Comedy is a stupid mix of genres?
Finally!

The end was so strange..﻿
What a fucking gay ass movie, dont waste your time, as soon you see 25min 
of it your gonna be like wow what a fucking waste starts out good at first 
but then it gets so fucking gayyyyy as in fucking retarded.﻿
I'm a HUGE movie geek but NO horror fan by any means. I like about 3-4 of 
'em and of course wasn't into this one. But after remembering Joss Whedon's 
name was attached I had to check it out and WHAT A MOVIE! Probably close to 
the top list of not only my horror picks but also one of the best films 
I've seen in a long time. I'd give it a 9/10. As a non-horror fan that's a 
big deal for me. Check this film out.﻿
this movie is so meta﻿
This movie is so insensitive to tobacco chewing rednecks!﻿
The main theme about this movie is illuminati and how the goverment has 
cages with all types of creatures that pepole in the usa should not 
discover ﻿
THOR!!!!!!!!!!!!﻿
This movie fucked my brain in the ass 10/10﻿
HOLY SHIT﻿
Wow. Just saw this. And let me tell u. It. Is. Phenomenal. Horrifying, 
psychotic, mysterious, and twisted. I recommend this extremely ﻿
My favorite movie! Man so many twists and turns!﻿
So much hate in this comments section for this movie. You guys need to 
relax, in the end it was just enjoyable. There were bits I didn't like too 
like how i thought the druggie was a little bit too much but i still 
enjoyed the movie. And don't give up after the first 25 minutes PLEASE. And 
to that guy who seems to be commenting on a ton of comment chains that this 
is bad and to never ever watch it, please go and read some pain-worshipping 
redneck girl's diary please.﻿
worst movie ever﻿
This is one of the most unexpected horror films I've ever seen... It's very 
different and very unique in a way which makes it so diverse from the other 
horror films..... I love it﻿
its the hunger games with more scary stuff﻿
R21 .... so violent and so many fucking and flirting parts the only great 
part is the story﻿
One of the worst movies I've ever seen﻿
I have seen cabin in the woods.﻿
I almost didn't watch this because I thought it was another dumb gore-fest 
"Saw" movie. But a friend said I really should see it. So I checked it on 
Netflix and only then did a realize it was from Joss Whedon and had Fran 
Kranz in it. It was a really unique take on the genre and I was glad I 
finally watched it.﻿
I saw masky!! Kool awesome.. but I already saw it...﻿
highly recommend this movie.
even though it isn't the scariest movie made recently, its like a big 
tribute to the horror genre﻿
whats the song at: 0:06 ?﻿
One of the biggest pieces of shit I've ever seen. Don't believe the hype 
because this movie sucks.﻿
The trailer ruined the movie so badly. The movie is so freaking cool.﻿
First, its a scary movie, second, it's a sci fi movie, third it's a fantasy 
movie.﻿
$$$$
stop writing comments like "oh my god this movie aint even scary i watched 
it when i was home alone" what are u trying to prove. i bet you were hiding 
under your blanket pissing yourself stfu. . ﻿
so im a pussy if it comes to horror movies but like this movie was not even 
close to be scary
there was maybe 1 scene where i actually jumped
bad film !﻿
It was definitely creepy, particularly the super 8 films of the lawnmower 
and the car I found the most disturbing. The music was probably the 
creepiest soundtrack I've heard too and some parts did make me jump, but I 
didn't think it was amazing, ok for a one-time watch. ﻿
Creepy. I jumped alot when I watched this movie. It had a good build up of 
suspense and the storyline was good too.﻿
Mr. Boogie !!! ha !!﻿
Mick Thomson is that you?﻿
the fact that people comment and say "i watched this with the lights 
off....bla bla bla.... not scary" show how fucking scared you were. just 
like when 5 year olds go through haunted houses and say "not scary not 
scary". what are you retards trying to prove?﻿
My girlfriend got really scared in this movie to the point that she doesn't 
want me to leave just for a sec. LOL﻿
I watched this movie outside in our backyard, we we're going to spend the 
night sleeping out there and guess what we did after the movie ended? 
Technically, I took a deep breath and said babe, it's time to go back into 
the house. I ain't scared, I just wanted to get my blanket. -.-﻿
Ima watch this movie. Looks good init (y)﻿
If You enjoy horror movies as much as i do, I recommend You watch this shit﻿
Hey Mr Oswalt, when you are in your up in your house at night, it might 
help to turn on a light.﻿
HOLYFUCK ﻿
I liked the first 2 but before midnight looks beter...﻿
eventhough i had my facepalm moments with this movies, i still fucking got 
scared. I really wanted this to be a realistic mystery horror than a 
supernatural movie.﻿
If you are suffering from constipation,  take your laptop. Take a seat in 
the toilet and watch this movie. Constipation problem gone.....﻿
Don't lie, you shit yourself. 
Creepy
Can't even bare to watch it full screen
And he probably remained there as well.
There wasn't any real resolving done as you said. I think it was more just 
trying to make the viewers think all the crazy was going on with the son as 
an attempt to 'surprise' you when it turned out to be the daughter, that 
was really the one bit they didn't do too well...
what do you mean? I can't get scared by horror movies, i don't know why 
really but i just don't and i often laugh at them and people who get 
scared. How am i in denial?
Selina quiet down with all that ruckus
SPOILER I think they were trying to make you think the son would be the 
killer in the end. It was smart.
it was boring as fuck. 
$$$$
i gotta see this movie, jesus﻿
The parasite in the movie is real but it is very tiny and it only happens 
to fish.﻿
The parasite is real though﻿
wow a found-footage movie that actually look good.﻿
Guys, there was an outbreak of a virus in Chesapeake Bay, but it wasn't 
like this. The parasite in this movie is real, but it doesn't eat humans or 
run that fast. The name of this parasite is the Cymothoa exigua. Look it up 
and you'll understand how unrealistic this movie really is, even though 
it's still pretty cool. ;)﻿
You know that's kinda funny about the creature mentioned. What about in the 
one Mexico? It's a small creature size of a pasta sea shell. That creature 
fuckin sting me and suck my blood out! like a freakin a bee, flea and 
mosquito! I did witness it! what it look like its color I mention size is 
green. A light color green. very light green have two black dot eyes. It 
can barely swim or walk in the sand mud water ocean beach. But idk what 
kinda bug ocean creature there are?﻿
That ending scene could never happen, it's not like they turn you into a 
zombie﻿
To all the people posting comments like "OMG THIS PARASITE IS REAL NEVER 
EATING FISH AGAIN" Note that this parasite only affects fish and it's 
actually one of the least harmful parasites. So calm your tits﻿
True whf...﻿
well idc, i didnt need anymore reasons not to go near water or the sea..﻿
not even a horror movie.. its like a documentary dont get scared﻿
gawd this movie was somewhat painful to watch.  i rate it 5/5 cause of the 
gore.  but it was just all too real for me XD.  imean there talking about a 
real species,  though its role in this movie was high made up for fictional 
purposed.  i got scared out of my mind.  Oh,  funny thing is.  "we're 
haveing sushi tonight" my dad says XD.   ﻿
This movie was almost too real .  I t should not have been made to any 
movie theatre   Every day people no being eaten alive  and blood 
everywhere  There is only a very dark side .  Evil personified   At least 
they did not make it in 3d﻿
I always love being able to trace the intro of stuff into geek 
consiousness. I'm pretty sure isopod's stem from a 2009 BBC report (

On Netflix Instant Watch! I Redboxed this a while back and was pleasantly 
surprised. A tad goofy, but genuinely creepy.﻿
﻿
Not a fan of the whole found footage thing, is it a genre a fad a cheap ass 
way to get a movie made. I have to give kudos to Blair Witch but still 
annoying. 

Tonight I watched The Bay. It is a found footage film about a outbreak in a 
small coastal town. The Government covers it all up and it takes the 
actions of a reporter and a wiki leaks like website to expose the truth. 

The plot was a lot like a 80's bug movie with some Godzilla style 
pseudoscience. The acting was ok, the bad guys came off kinda phony. But 
since the bad guys were all from the gumberment It was to be expected. I 
think however they tried to hard to make the mayor look corrupt 
and unlikable. 

The kicker is unlike most found footage this one was not 
so nausea inducing. Yea there was some footage that was, but most of it was 
from security cameras or people standing still. I do have to call foul on a 
few things. They were able to get a recording of a skype call between the 
CDC and Homeland Security. But kept showing cell phone camera footage of a 
TV with the local news on it. Also I guess for creative purposes there are 
a few scenes that there is no way it was from a security camera or hand 
held. There was one were the camera guy was filming a thing on a roof. From 
where he was at he was shooting up at a 45% angle. We then see the reporter 
then back to the thing zoomed in on. But now he is almost horizontal with 
it. 

I know nit picking. The Bay a fun toss back to a 80's movie done 
surprisingly well as a found footage movie. ﻿
To round out my triumvirate of crap horror movies we have The Bay. The idea 
was mildly interesting but the script and execution let it down. I watch 
horror movies to be scared and not to be lectured about environmental 
problems related to industrialisation. Bah. I will watch Berberian Sound 
Studio soon! ﻿
Tonight's movie the bay anyone saw it, any good ﻿
*I really am a fan of these films shot with handheld cameras.*﻿
Watching this piece of shit movie now, some load of bollocks, so many 
people making bullshit movies nowadays it makes me sick﻿
Not that scary﻿
I live in maryland!!!﻿

Should have used your petronas.﻿
DANIELL RADC-
NO! HE'S HARRY POTTER!﻿
harry... you said you'd stay out of trouble﻿
Wish there were more movies like this one. Brilliant set, story and 
atmosphere, just perfect.﻿
more scarry than insidious chapter 1 or 2 good job Harry Potter !﻿
Fuck this im outta here﻿
Fantastic film. Daniel Radcliffe does an excellent job.﻿
Expeliamus﻿
Awesome movie, full on creepy.﻿
I went to a friend's party and saw this. The night after I had a nightmare 
NOT about the movie, but about the people at the party. It was a crazy 
party.﻿
Absolutely love this movie one of the best horror/thriller movies in years. 
A great story and a great cast. We need more movies like this. ﻿
This movie looks so good. It has a good actor; good environment; good 
setting(England-I think- small town and it takes place in around 1800, just 
wonderful). And that poem was excellent, so classy.﻿
the play of this is abosultey terrifying , gave me more nightmares than the 
movie ﻿
‎﻿
Just finished the movie, outcome: I sharded twice.﻿
It's not as scary as it looks.........
Or is it?
Brilliant film: buy and watch﻿
I want to see this so bad! What is it rated? And is there anything 
inappropriate in it?﻿
USE YOUR WAND, HARRY! USE YOUR WAND! c:
This was a good movie﻿
Harry Potter's an actor?﻿
Ive seen the whole movie its epic!:)﻿
10 points for gryfondor!﻿
I loved this movie! Not the scariest but truly worth watching. супер﻿
Spooky, no doubt about that. ﻿
Flaming hell crap﻿
This movie isn't even scary﻿
$$$$
They literally made another saw movie. What a fucking sad disgrace of 
horror. ﻿
If you like gory movies, watch this. I walked into a room and saw the 
dancing scene by accident. talk about messed up... I only like 
watching jacked up movies when im in a terrible mood.﻿
I agree with you juggalojack13 but I just love The first and I haven't yet 
seen this one! If their gonna make a third one... they should definitely 
explain why this dude is crazy as f*ck! ﻿
Jason Stewart = Issac Clark....DEAD SPACE MOVIE!﻿
that only works if there is a half naked girl showing her tits,ass or both 
:D
He played Barsad in "The Dark Knight Rises".
Josh Stewart is so underrated.
Lol wowwwww
cant wait to see it
they all die in the end
I am here for Daniel Sharman but i can't found him lol 
FROM THE WRITERS OF ALL THE BAD SAW MOVIES
you forgot to add your name into that sentence, because that's true, can't 
even appreciate a movie that he only knows of from trailers, grow up, boy
This movie was awsome! No boring part,seriously,no boring part at all! 
Creepy like saw,exept this is what happends when the people escape,lmao and 
exitment from start to finish,a must see! And SPOILER ALERT*** in the end 
of this trailer the killer,he doesn't catch they guy infront of him,the guy 
knows he's there and leaves lmao
this looks fucking badass.
I this like a second part to The Collector?
Typical American horror (gorerror) - teens, blood, multilated corpses 
flying around the room, blood, and that's all. 5/10. I am wondering what 
happened to Collector later after the movie ends. :D Probably they will 
make Do-It-Yourself movie for psychopaths where Arkin tortures him for half 
and hour :D
stupid
They won't to be on collector hands!
it sucks your mom's tits while you suck dick XDD, bet you can't even come 
up with a very good reason as to why this and the Collector "suck"
i watched this movie it wazz scary gory and awsum movie evur 
i suppose you're callin' me "bitch" cause you think it's an insult? i'm 
used to morons and complainers calling me names, so you pretty much suck at 
insulting me
The main guy? Josh Stewart? no he is from Criminal Minds and The Dark 
Knight Rises.
Peter chao sent me
I fucking cant wait to see this!
$$$$
Tried to watch this movie when I woke up, gave up. I wasn't even watching 
the movie after a while, I was just going "I wonder how much total 
Amityville bullshit this is, and how much is actual Jewish demon possession 
belief. I wonder if I even want to look that up on the Internet. Probably 
not."﻿
Comedy? ﻿
Fuck that demon i whanna get that box right now right here and then i whill 
burn that fucking box﻿
and my friend told me this was a drama movie....LAIR 
going to watch frozen:)))﻿
It looks nice y do u not want﻿
can someone give me a link to the true story? I wanna see it!﻿
This is based on a true story, and actually happen to a guy and anyone who 
touched the box﻿
This is an interesting film, it is not "a masterpiece" but it is definitely 
worth watching. It offers a different perspective and yes, the box reminds 
me of Hellraiser.﻿
Definitely one of the better "possession" movies. Enjoyed this one﻿
What's the song in this trailer?﻿
WARNING SPOILER ALERT! The Jewish guy dies at the end!﻿
Shitty movie. If youre over 30 youve seen 15000 movies like this and all 
just awfull﻿
Best part 0:22﻿
PFFFFTTTT... Who needs sleep!? "Reaction after watching movie"﻿
haahahahhahahahahahahahhahaha finally i can understand the gif asdfgh﻿
SO SCARY﻿
The terror master Sam Raimi﻿
Oh Shit now someone else will pick up the box, open it and Voila Abizo or 
whatever the spirit called will possess him/her -_-﻿
Based on a True Story ? lol

hmhm... sure. :P

People are stupid, just a fact.

Still good movie, you can really see that stuff like this will happen in 
real to. :P:P:P haha.﻿
how is this based on a true story wtf o.O ﻿
the movie is too funny I watched when I was 11 and laughed all the way its 
too funny when the girl beats up the boy in school. And the teacher1 who 
wears no shoes in a classroom you can easily tell its not a true story. The 
only true part is when the parents spilt up.﻿
In my opinion, this trailer does not do the movie justice. I wasnt 
expecting much when I watched it but was pleasantly surprised. The DVDs 
extras have a featurette about the "Dibic box" and what exactly the film 
was based on. The whole girl possession story never happened. Its still a 
great movie. Very creepy atmosphere and very satisfying horror flick. Give 
it a shot.﻿
scary moment of all time: 0:21﻿
Maybe I'm too old for these movies. I've watched Paranormal Activity 4, 
Carrie and The Possession alone in my room at midnight. I'm not even scared 
or sth. Yeah mb it's cos I'm already 16﻿
Watched it two weeks ago it was shit﻿
$$$$
is it just me or is there going to be alot of dragging out in the movie?﻿
I actually laughed and screamed at the characters because they were so dumb 
when I watched this XD﻿
I don't what people say but i laughed so heard when the mom died because it 
look like a cartoon. I was watching it with my friends and the mom was just 
standing yelling help then she just was toss into the air like a rag doll 
and fell down on her back and it was hilarious! In the trailer it was scary 
when the girl was raised by the kid but in the actual movie it look so 
fake! If you are a fan of horror movies don't watch it cause it was only 
scary at the last 5 minutes and the movie is an hour and half!﻿
This is real?? Its so bad i thought it was a parody or a fake trailer﻿
Parody of this on my channel!﻿
paranormal activity 4﻿
Scary﻿
worst 1 dollar I ever spent at a red box!﻿
The only thing keeping me from sleeping is alexa﻿
Whats up with that female mob in end? I was like wtf ..﻿
1:50 who the eff is holding the camera?!!?﻿
crap movie﻿
This is a good movie. It may be slow, but has more scares in it than 
the other Paranormal Activity movies.
I wonder if the makers of this film series can summon up a story ever 
better next time when Paranormal Activity 5 comes out this year.﻿
1:39 Rape Time! XD﻿
I love how throughout these movies that no matter what happens... They 
never drop the camera if you were scared like that, the camera would DROP!!﻿
I saw the movie and liked it. So this explains that Robbie's mother is 
Katie and Alex's little brother is Hunter. Because in the bath scene,Wyatt 
was taking a bath when a unseen force grabbed him into the water and 
drowned him. That's when he started saying his name is Hunter. So then 
Robbie leaves but Katie keeps stalking the house.﻿
lol kinect advert.﻿
I live in Henderson Nevada..

o.o﻿
People have perhaps worse. See also awesome movie Grudge and Bloody Mary. 
A lot of scary but try to find a whole HD movie. greeting﻿
If people watch not just the 4th movie but  alllll of the rest of the 
movies you would know that the little boy's mother and aunt that was 
kidnapping him have a crazy witch grandmother....And if things don't scare 
you that pop out then what does? Blood? Guts? Gore? Devil rituals? Nothing? 
I'm just curious for a survey. What gives you the chills? Please post :)!﻿
just finished watching it﻿
I didn't get this movie. The kid Robbie was a weird ass kid, random shit 
happened, and a random ending with no explanation of the army of possessed 
chicks. Somebody explain. I watched this movie like 5 times and I'm still 
confused﻿
I found this really funny rather then scary stuff just pops out of nowhere 
it's halirious !!!! Easapicaly when the women snaps that guys neck ﻿
this movie is  supershit; just watched it.
its not even s out of scary, and i dont usually watch movies (i was at the 
friends b-day party so i did.. ) and this shit just reminded me why i dont 
watch em. some slow stupid crap﻿
I did watch it.
But it was boring. 
It's not scary at all....?﻿
$$$$
wow, looks appalling...﻿
Chernobyl Diaries in real life - Reaktor 4. in Pripyat﻿
I saw the movie... i dont get it,were thoes stalking men zombies or maniacs 
and rapists?﻿
Is this like a zombie film or something, cause I'm having doubts about this 
already?﻿
Go to Chernobyl he said. It would be fun he said ﻿
Scroll up and watch the trailer you pus- wait a second, this film isn't 
even scary...﻿
this movie is so bad...﻿
Paul (Jonathan Sadowski) is a Stupid Older Brother Of Chris that got all 
the them Friends Killed, The Dead Characters Uri - (Dimitri Diatchenko) 
Chris - (Jesse McCartney) Amanda - (Devin Kelley) Natalie - (Olivia Taylor 
Dudley) Zoe - (Ingrid Bolsø Berdal) and Michael (Nathan Phillips)﻿
radioactive murderers, seems like another film I can watch to laugh my 
lungs out﻿
It's like someone tried to do a "Wrong Turn" look a like with something 
from real life...﻿
just got the movie today its lame  1 of 5 stars if a zombie movie is what u 
seek
who wants the vudu download code for the vid came with box (redemption 
expires 6/18/15)﻿
I thought it was ok. sure there were a lot of decisions that defied logic, 
but that's a common thread in horror movies. let's split up and check out 
that noise...﻿
Garbage ending, ﻿
Nice ﻿
IT was a good movie, but HONESTLY THE WHOLE TRAILER SHOWS EVERYTHING U NEED 
TO KNOW﻿
Wasn't my personal cup of tea but all the "too soon" and "making fun of a 
tragedy" things took me by surprise ._.

The point of horror movies is to scare us and people will feel more 
connected to a movie if it is founded in some part of reality. Whether it 
be some tiny link between people's common fears(like whats sitting just 
behind the door, or what is standing in the shadow just out of sight), in 
more solid connections like real life locations/events, or with things that 
seem possible and could hypothetically happen(basically disease/outbreak 
movies). Movies would just be boring and  not relatable if writers couldn't 
take real life events and portray them in a different light. 

But I'm probably preaching to the wrong choir here as movie audiences, 
especially horror lovers, from my experience, have very drastic differences 
in taste. What one person finds terrible, boring and offensive another 
person thinks its the greatest horror movie of the decade.﻿
there should be a Godzilla movie set around Chernobyl, the disaster 
of 1986? in the story there is  nuclear reactor leak, but what if this leak 
created a giant mutant creature  that has been kept hidden but is unleashed 
by evil scientists the mutant and Godzilla fight to the death, 
after Godzilla has smashed up Moscow﻿

This brings back memories from when I played Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. 
My favorite mission took place here.﻿
Call of Duty - The Movie﻿
Why give such a interesting movie idea to the paranormal activity 
director??﻿
It were alright until the ending﻿
Chernobyl is one of my favourite places I've been wanting To go there since 
I was 4 now I'm 11﻿
This has to be one of the worst piece of shit movies I have ever seen, I 
could take a dump and film it and it would be better than this trash.  Do 
yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this god-awful film yet, don't waste 
your time, you will be wasting 90 minutes of your life.﻿

if you see a mistake)﻿
1:04 LOL XD that girl﻿
1:15 at those two guys in the front. They're both laughing, while everyone 
in the room is crying or making some weird ass face.﻿
Watch my scary movie trailer on my channel! Movie coming soon﻿
This trailer is a joke right ? This movie is just like a new way to swallow 
up a bunch of sleeping pills﻿
Anyone know this was edited in Vegas pro the actual movie﻿
My first thought was: thats one big ass house for a couple. Lmao﻿
If they would have left this movie as JUST a ghost movie and not add the 
demon and witchcraft crap into it, it would have been a fun movie.  They 
could have made several sequels, adding to the ghost element, and never 
telling you what "IT" was, and just keep the audience guessing.  They 
ruined it with that whole Katie and demon thing.  I lost interest after the 
first PA movie.  They had something going good with that first movie, then 
they ruined it by a stupid ending, and even more stupid sequels.﻿
Is this the first one﻿
I just watched this movie. Now I realise that horror movies don't seem to 
be held to the same standards of quality as other genres seem to, but even 
for that... Just save yourself the 90 minutes and don't bother, because 
Paranormal Activity is fairly shit. As if it wasn't enough that the scary 
sequences aren't scary compared to better horror films, the characters and 
story suck too. Aside from the lack of character exposition, there's just 
little annoying faults in the writing throughout the movie. Good horror 
movies make you invested in the ordeal and hope that the character/s will 
survive. Though in this movie, the woman is a bit of a condescending bitch 
and the boyfriend is just a straight up dipshit. So by the end of the movie 
you're only really hoping that whatever is tormenting them gets its way and 
ruins their lives somehow. If you haven't watched it yet, you'd be better 
off seeing The Conjuring or something along those lines.﻿
#2: PARANORMAL ACTIVITY. I know...you are freaking out wondering why on 
earth I would conform to such a silly franchise, but lets think back. Go 
back to the first movie, when it came out...before all the crappy sequels 
and prequels. If we go back to the first movie...not knowing what happened 
before or after, simply taking this movie as a stand alone phenomenon then 
it is actually freakishly scary. This movie is filmed from an at-home, 
personal perspective. The actors did a great job at creating their 
characters, and it is eerie how we can identify with them and yet all these 
horrifying things are happening to them. I really enjoyed this movie 
because even on a tiny budget they still made it seem real, and it plays 
off of our worst fear of not being able to see our enemies. I was such a 
fan of this movie, and even after all the mystery was frittered away this 
one still maintains it's true identity as one of the scariest movies of all 
time.﻿
Hey youtubers, sorry for bothering and i know this comment would be 
annoying you but it would be really helpful if you would watch our videos, 
sub, like and comment. It only takes you 2 minutes to do this, but these 2 
minutes means a lot to us . thank you :)﻿
fuck﻿
Just watched it, didn't jump once, jesus.. There reaction tho o-o﻿
I was going to watch the full movie... I changed my mind.﻿
how can be scared of that kind of bull ****﻿
So creepy﻿
This was the only good one. Less is more as they say, and i thought without 
the use of a soundtrack or much fx aided in the overall feel of the movie. 
Just think of some weird shit like this happened at your house. It would be 
10x scarier wouldn't it? (Think from a inside perspective)  And what about 
when they found that picture in the attic from her BURNED DOWN HOUSE. That 
shit was fucking creepy!﻿
This movie was about as scary as a smurfs episode. You want scary then 
watch paranormal witness or A haunting. If you want to really be scared 
then watch A Haunting in conneticut(not the movie the documentary).﻿
the creators of paranormal activity created the purge ﻿
After the amazing saw franchise we get this yearly trash known as 
paranormal activity﻿
Good film, innovative in its approach. Check out my review on my blog:

i have read some comments and i noticed that there are angry women from the 
clit scene and some over 9000 pussy slave men that agree with them cause 
they are pussy slaves and that men should always agree...i don't agree  
this movie was good  was so shit....oh god give me the strength to leave 
peacefully among so many idiots (70%) in the earth....﻿
this is CRAP.﻿
Sentimental nonsense. Nothing terrifying only ridicoulous.﻿
Fucked up -.-﻿
i really cant believed it that other people have the right to make this 
kind of movie. very disappointed with this. Jesus Christ is our saviour He 
is our "The way, The Truth and The Life" we are all sinners I really cant 
believe why other people still don't have faith with Him no matter what 
happen when the time has come we will still calling his righteous name 
Jesus Christ even if you are AntiChrist.﻿
the woman was ugly but the kid was cute.why did she cut off her clit?the 
clit scene was most disgusting and disturbing.﻿
I can not masturbate without thinking of a certain scene in this movie....

+Onmysheet : Salo is garbage. Nothing but shock cinema with no redeeming 
qualities.﻿
It has been three or four years since I have seen this film, and it still 
disturbs me. No, it isn't scary in the typical "horror movie" kind of 
way...but it is terrifying in the mental and spiritual sort of way.  No 
ghosts or monsters.  I interpreted it as the struggle of a woman attempting 
to deal with her own sexuality, failures as a mother, natural instincts and 
drive, femininity, the label of women as being the source of all evil, 
etc., as well as her husband's attempts to "treat" her without really 
hearing or understanding her. It is art, and beautifully done.﻿
fucked up in a stylish way, i suppose..﻿
What if she was dead after the funeral and William just talking his dead 
wife and punish his self for his wife death an son﻿
Green goblin, what are you doing in there﻿
Probably the scariest movie I ever watched. I don't recommend it; it got me 
distracted 3 weeks after seeing it one year ago. It doesn't matter what 
others say, this movie was sheer art, but I don't have the guts to watch it 
again. After a year, I still get shivers down my spine only when I think 
about it.﻿
this movie was not that shocking ..wtf you are all pussy? a serbian movie 
that was a shocking movie﻿
I love this film﻿
Charlotte Gainsbourg is far from being ugly. With that being said, I'm off

This movie isnt scary but its funny as hell ﻿
I love that movie, the ending was a pain in the ass but still loved it :)﻿

Douglas, there are some "Good" zombie movies out there. 28 days later is 
one example of one that is sort of "good" - you gotta remember the genre. 
Zombies have been done to death and it's hard to really scare people with 
zombies anymore. The zombie movie follows a formula, either a disease or 
disorder or something like that creates wild packs of mutant humans looking 
to bite other humans and either kill or infect them. Hard to really twist 
that into something unique after so many have been done.. That's why so 
many are now B movies. Because we've seen it all done before. 

So until someone ACTUALLY turns the zombie genre on it's head, we need to 
judge these films on other qualities - the quality of the acting, the plot 
density or writing or camerawork/photography. Soundtrack. Whatever that 
secondary thing is that makes you really love a movie and separate it from 
the crap. ﻿
I like this simple little flick from here in Canada called Pontypool.   It 
basically takes place in a radio station during a live talk radio show.   
 It is not your traditional 'Zombie' movie and its more like Stephen King's 
"Cell" for the 'infection' and propagation, but the perspective during the 
outbreak is very clever.  

Pontypool Trailer (HD)﻿
Oh. my. God. I'm in the middle of watching this right now, and it's 
freaking the hell out of me. This is a really well done psychological 
thriller. If you're interested in this type of movie, I highly recommend 
watching *Pontypool* on Netflix.﻿
One of the most original and frightening movies I have seen in years. No 
political correctness, no small-talk, no American bullshit jokes...just 
pure horror and great acting.﻿
This movie was dumb to me I give it 2 stars. Took too long for action and 
then I hate when evil wins in the end. But that's just my take on the movie 
I hated it. Now you want to see a movie, WATCH WORLD WAR Z. Now that's a 
movie 4 stars﻿
Nah﻿
This is either a love it or hate it film, it all takes place in basically 
one room and theres just a bunch of talking so if you're looking for action 
this is not for you. Personally i didn't like it, found it to be pretty 
boring even tho it had some pretty unique ideas that keep you thinking. Not 
really a horror movie more of a mystery/ suspense type. Overall unique idea 
for zombies that keeps you thinking and guessing but in the end your left 
unsatisfied and pretty bored. 4.5-5/10﻿
someone told me that exist other vesion, it's that true?﻿
Have to give it props on originality but the premise of the movie was dumb- 
felt more like a dark comedy then a thriller ﻿
This was a thousand times
Better than world war Z just because it starts out with action packed 
scenes and has a happy ending doesnt make it a good movie, it makes it a 
typical boring movie, it cant always be pot of gold at the end of every 
rainbow﻿

Great fucking movie. Right up there with Night of the Living Dead and Dawn 
of the Dead﻿
DONT READ THESE FUCKING COMMENTS! Cunts spoil everything ! FUCK﻿
helvede ja xD
wut? 
@geemevilela no you're not... seeing this trailer doesn't make me want to 
watch the movie at all xD
If you want people to "watch in HQ", you need to upload it in HQ.
Che, gastámelo al boludo de necrolyte23. Decile asi: "Hey you?!, 
necrolyte23. don't stop sucking my Spanish dick!".
this was a great movie had me glued cause i couldn't figure it out but when 
i did i still didn't figure it out so yes another great horror movie a 10 
worth watching his on netflix!! 
i haven't seen this in so long. is it weird that when i saw the title of 
the movie, all i thought of was a cowboy hat? lol.
It really does have its similarities with Land and Dawn, make no mistake. 
Hell, Land and Dawn arguably have more meat on their bones when it comes to 
social commentaries. But Pontypool does remain unique. Masterclass in "less 
is more" tension.
It's not something you've seen before - its like a twilight zone episode 
and very original in regards to the story and event. I don't wanna spoil it 
further but its so worth watching if you liked Twilight Zone or Outer Limits
one of the best movies i've seen ever , because this is something different 
, its not cool specials effects or expensive costumes its all about the 
plot and story that keeps you on your toes . 10/10
Always knew the zombie apocalypse would start in ponty lol. 
is amazing :D 
$$$$
just watch the last 20 minutes, because the rest is boring as f﻿
hahaha suck trailer, gl﻿
I'm only going to watch it because of Jocelin Donahue.﻿
I Loved this film the suspense is almost unsettling like the whole time. 
Your're waiting for something big to happpen and then when its already 
happening you almost want to believe it isnt happening.﻿
It looks like some movie from the 70's﻿
I enjoyed the movie but I think it's only enjoyable if you are really into 
slow burn horror films.﻿
Not much to it. Bad movie. ﻿
ending was bad :/! the tension created was gud :/! !!  ! ! not as expected 
! :)﻿

I respect someones opinion in regards to what they like as far as 
preference, but I may not understand. For example, I'll never understand 
how anyone can like "The Blair Witch Project" much less say it's their 
favorite film. All that shaky camera handling made my head hurt, not to 
mention it was boring. But, that's me.﻿
This movie scared the shit out of me.﻿
the worst movie I ve ever watched OMG!!!! 1 hour nothing happens, and then 
the end supposed to be "scary" ????? FUCK YOU ﻿
This film isnt for everyone i watched it a few years back and it still 
remains 1 of my favourite horror films i mean for me its up there with 
rosemarys baby, the whicker man, halloween and most stuff lucio fulci 
directed. It is a VERY slow film to get going but i just love the fact the 
director didnt feel the need to play it down for the saturday night horror 
squad. A smart horror film that is worth a watch.﻿
good horror but shit ending﻿
The suspense in this movie is right up there with the rest of them. They 
drag you along for the ride, then just unleash hell at the end. The problem 
is that they drag you along for so long, the ending loses some of it's 
punch. Sure, there are bumps and thumps here and there, nothing but cheap 
scares. C- at best. And Red Skies by The Fixx would have been a better 
choice...just sayin'.﻿
Underrated movie, just can't understand why people don't like it. It's 
great to me﻿
So their paying her $400 to stay in a big house?
its funny how i saw the actor that plays the priest in this movie in 
another movie 2 days ago lol him playing a serial kill haha
So much better than the torture porn out there. Movie is awesome.
....with the devil.
i almost died.
Pagan or satanic ritual. Most of these rituals involve sex of some sort, so 
one of the men clearly had sex with her while she was in that forced 
unconscious from the drugs in the pizza. This is why the old man pursues 
her into the graveyard and tries to get her to listen to him because he 
needs to explain this.
i agree. not too many good horror films now days...
probably, but i don't think it has to do with the low-budget, Paranormal 
Activity costed 300.000 to make and made $195.000.000 at the box office

I saw this movie it's great! ﻿
Good work Isabelle :P First this amazing movie, and then Clove in The 
Hunger Games <3 I love it﻿
My friend's older sister literally saw we were watching this movie, and she 
stopped and looked at us, laughed and said "God, this movie is so fucked. 
You will not expect the ending" she was right, saw none of that coming...﻿
I don't know﻿
It came out on my birthday﻿
this movies good﻿
I remember I saw the hunger games and I thought "holy shit is that the girl 
from Orphan?"﻿
I am an adult but i was an orphan and this trailer was so fun to watch i 
want to get the movie...﻿
This film is amazing﻿
Is this a good movie? I don't know it I should watch it or not...﻿
I worked with a woman like the Orphan.﻿

i have ever seen & the ending is awesome, you will not see it coming.﻿
Who wacth it at middle night? alone?﻿

let's take another look at the first Dead Snow trailer﻿
Trailer for the movie Dead Snow, which is about Nazi zombies.
And this movie came out BEFORE the Stick of Truth video game.﻿
Thank God this had no subtitles, that would have been too helpful﻿

lol, no comments :D﻿
creepy.....﻿
At 1:47﻿
Wjat the song at the end﻿
lindsay: 2:15 probably the best scene I remember..that machine gun concert 
was epic
so of course we need to feature the first "Dead Snow" trailer, give it up 
for Herzog 2:04
1:42 jajaja﻿

I've heard these movies are very brutal...I want to see them!﻿
this movie is all about traps and games but when you fail to the games u 
will die﻿
Awesome! I just watched this video at --> Your Movie HQ . com
HQ?...
$$$$
I hope that this movie will be good. Nicole is such an amazing actress but 
she didn't have the best movies in recent years in my opinion (except 
Rabbit Hole, very touching and she was brilliant). I miss her in good 
movies with good roles like The Others, The Hours, Moulin Rouge!, To Die 
For, ... I hope this will be one of them :)﻿
My God, how many tubs of Vaseline did they use to make this movie look this 
way?﻿
OH WOW.. This looks great. Nicole Kidman as Princess Grace...  Tim Roth as 
Prince Ranier, Frank Langella as Fr. Francis Tucker, her closest advisor... 
 apparently the "storybook marriage" was not all it was cracked up to be in 
public...﻿
Nicole Kidman looks absolutely perfect as Grace Kelly.
Truly a masterpiece.﻿
i'd much prefer this with carey mulligan. soz nicole﻿
Why nicole kidman looks like 30 years old ? Jajaja﻿
Nicole looks AMAZING, not like a princess, like the Goddes! like 35
in this movie not even a year more, very natural preserved(and doesnt
use botox, she used to for a while) There aren´t many actresses who
can keep up with her skills... if anybody watched  "dogville", "Moulin
Rouge", "the hours & others and "eyes wide shut" knows what i mean.
She deserves her roles and will get a nominations at the Oscars, you
will see (jealous bitches)﻿
The description calls Grace Kelly "the 20th century's most iconic 
princess," but I think that tittle goes to Diana.﻿
Grace of Monaco - HD Main Trailer﻿
Can someone please tell me the name of this amazing song, starting at 1:12?!
Its so wonderful but i cant find it!﻿
Which song is the one from 1:21? I love it but i do not know it... ﻿
The music that starts at 1:21 is the same background music for the P&G 
thank you mom campaign. So now when I watch this trailer I won't be able to 
think straight without remembering that commercial. Haha﻿
Excellente'      Grace Kelly of Monaco    ﻿
What's the name of the opera that opens this trailer?﻿
what was that piece of music in the second half of the trailer?﻿
Looks incredible! Can't wait! The perfect role for Kidman!﻿
El nuevo trailer de Grace Of Monaco starring Nicole Kidman, Tim Roth, Frank

﻿
1:20 track name is "Divenire" Music composed by Ludovico Einaudi.﻿
Nicole looks amazing at 0:42. I think the casting was spot on. Nicole is a 
bit older than Grace was at the time but Grace aged quickly (while 
remaining stunningly beautiful) as a Princess. ﻿
Not sure about Nicole Kidman being cast in this part but might be worth a 
look.  The font is distracting. I hope they get rid of it.﻿
Grace Kelly was perfect.﻿
Great love Nicole ... When is this coming out?﻿
A gifted actress like Nicole can handle any roles regardless of age or 
appearance.﻿
I love Nicole Kidman and I think this is a great role for her. Very excited 
to see this!﻿
I think someone like Charlize theron would have been so much better for 
this role!Nicole kidman face is a little bit weird and unatural with all 
that botox!﻿

*The Act of Killing*

There are few times when a movie or documentary induced such a wide range 
of frequently varying emotions in me as the recent and critically acclaimed 
masterpiece that is *The Act of Killing.* I had never even heard of the 
film until +Koen De Paus listed it in his *Top Movies of 2013* list and I 
decided to add it to my own "to-see" list. Months later and I finally get 
around to watching it.

The basic premise is a documentary-style interview with some of the militia 
thugs involved in the mass murders and overthrow of the Indonesian 
government in the mid 1960s, who are invited to recreate some of their 
exploits and attrocities in B-Grade movie style (these segments are 
separate to the main documentary and serve only as a backdrop and 
reenactment device). Anwar serves as the lead and focus of the piece, a man 
who personally murdered with his own hands over 1,000 people, and who has 
not and will not ever be prosecuted for his crimes. 

I can't help but wonder why we aren't suitably educated about these events 
via a robust history class in school? Why did I only learn about this now?

This documentary has so many different historical, political, emotional, 
and philosophical threads and the deeper you dig into it the more complex 
the whole becomes. I felt sadness, anger, rage, disgust, horror, disbelief, 
bemusement, and pity . . . all at multiple times and varying intensities. 
Also shock - shock at how easily seemingly normal people could conceal 
sadistic monsters lurking within. 

Get a hold of this if you can, and give it a watch. 

#documentary   #theactofkilling   #history  ﻿
awful﻿
Possibly the most incredible movie ever made.﻿
 The "Peasants revolt" against Mao Colonialist communists was bloody, but 
self defence often is.

  If the communists had not tried to colonise Indonesia then no problems 
would have arisen.

  The communists did much worse in China, USSR and Cambodia.﻿
One story I heard from someone about their grandfather was that he had one 
night, people break into his house, scared for his life and knowing what he 
said next could kill him, he said "What can I do comrades?!". He knew the 
men that broke in (to hide) were Communists because if the Anti-Communists 
broke in, he would already have a bullet in him. 

The Anti-Communist Indonesian Genocide is always amazing to me, because 
it's actually larger than any single Communist Purge, even Stalin's which 
resulted in the arrest of around 700,000 people, yet nobody ever hears a 
fucking thing about it, while we get Stalin and Mao rammed down our throats 
24/7.﻿
So my favorite film from 2013 was the most in your face documentary (yeah I 
saw Blackfish), outdid the horror films, hit you in the face harder than 
Apollo Creed -  an unbelievable Grand Guignol and horror metafilm which 
left you thinking at times that they should not have done this but I am 
very glad they did.  This film will stay with you forever.  Nothing like it 
out there. ﻿
For foreigners, this is probably just another documentary about a 20th 
century genocide in some far away tropical land. For me, as an Indonesian, 
this documentary movie is thoroughly disturbing. After all, we are all 
still living the results of that dark episode today. The Suharto 
dictatorship that rose to power atop the purge of a million lives, the 
executioners who became the country's leaders and power brokers till this 
day, and the extinction of what was once the third largest Communist party 
in the world. I wonder if I, as I am living in a capitalist Indonesia, am a 
beneficiary of that genocide. My family has been blessed by and benefited 
from Indonesia's current economy, seeing as we are business owners. If 
those killings had not taken place, would I not be able to live the way I 
do today? The thought that I could smile and be happy now because a million 
people were killed more than 40 years ago haunts me. Alas, it might be 
another decade before this country can confront its dark past without 
reservation.﻿
I never felt a moment of peace while watching this.﻿
One of the most powerful documentaries I have ever seen. Check it out ﻿
W-T-H?﻿
Saw this yesterday, and this one was easily the most bizarre and 
mindboggling movie I've watched a while. Your mind will be constantly 
cycling between being baffled, stunned, shocked, and wanting to laugh at 
the absurdity - and once the credits start rolling, you feel somewhat numb. 
That said, I really, really recommend finding a movie theater that plays it 
and checking it out. (Or if you happen to live in NA: a rental service.)

Mind you, no actual violence is being shown in the movie - everything 
that's in there are the scenes recreated by these people who did what they 
did, which itself is an utterly absurd procedure. Still, depictions and 
descriptions are graphic. It's a psychologically demanding movie for sure, 
and it definitely makes you discuss aspects of the human nature and 
society. "'War crimes' are defined by the winners - and I'm a winner" is 
such an essential piece of the rationalization, and if you see these people 
being cheered on and boasting about what they have done, you'll be 
dumbfounded. ﻿
"The Act of Killing" documentary really shows the dark side of democracy. 
 Basically, these "gangsters" are hired by the Indonesian democratic 
government to kill millions of "communists".  They never hide what they are 
doing and openly extort local businesses.  As a result they are made 
national heroes.  It is really amazing to get a glimpse into the lives of 
these people.  It would have been terrifying to live in Indonesia when 
these guys were rounding up millions with their death squads.

The Act of Killing - Official Trailer (HD)﻿
like of you come from Dnews﻿
They were right... it was quite possibly the most compelling movie I have 
ever seen. I have never walked out of a movie theater feeling that drained 
and alive at the same time. All other movies that have created this feeling 
for me have come through film class or DVD collections or online access... 
it was something else to see on the big screen. My top movie of 2013 
without hesitation.﻿
@warriorprince,
Internal power struggles have nothing to do with, nor justifies, the 
Indonesian massacre of half a million innocent civilians. And they 
initially justified the genocide by calling their opponents "CIA backed," 
not communists. They later called it a war against communist after they 
needed a scapegoat.﻿
Does anyone know the name of the song at the start? Kind of has a nice flow 
to it﻿
I just seen this and it is utterly jaw dropping and burned into my mind. I 
have heard the term "death squads" I always thought these were a military 
disciplined unit murdering in a clinical way and I thought this appalling. 
BUT a death squad are not necessarily military as they were not here and it 
is like unleashing a hord of savage dogs on everybody, 2.5 million people 
were killed by these "gangsters". That makes it another of the 20th century 
genocides of which few know about. Of which no-body was taken to account.
The film is a timeless masterpiece and I now believe the Indonesian 
government and the west who supported it, have human right questions to be 
answered. The victims and their families need a voice and to be heard.﻿
Thank you for sacrificing that part of yourself to save others (like 
myself). This looks like a groundbreaking film and one that could change my 
perspective on, well, everything, but I don't want to go through the 
emotional hell
what a revelation you nimwhit 
Very good movie, well done, and original. 
Well of course, because i don't agree with everything your mommy lied to 
you about. How adorable 
You are hated all around the world. really. 
Genocide is a product of the human race. History goes back farther than the 
existence of western civilization.

A decent documentary, but it's not much more than another episode of 
Dateline mystery. Worth a watch though.﻿
Acknowledge the great style of the documentary. Very original. I just didnt 
care enough about the people involved. 6.5/10﻿
can anyone tell me the song that starts at 0:40 ? please ???﻿

i also loved Michael (original father)..how forgiving and greatfull he was 
in the end...his wife having an affair got him writing again and the the 
positive impact  the daughter(to another man)  had on his life...beautiful.﻿
I've just watched this film and I thought it was perhaps the worst 
documentary I have ever seen. I only kept watching as I thought there would 
be some great revelation or that all of their idea of what happened were 
wrong of some important revaluation about how we view the world. I just 
hated it and think her entire family are totally irredeemable, boring 
people. The more you learned the less you cared. ﻿
I had trouble sleeping this morning and I watched this documentary. Thank 
you very much. First rate. This has cured me of insomnia.﻿
I'm sorry but this thing is just about who you know not what you know and 
she must know somebody big.﻿

Thanks to City Screen in York for another fantastic Discover Tuesdays film.

Nice film...﻿
i did wander off twice to get snacks..however it still managed to intrigue 
my mind and touch my heart..a lot. i looked at it from the perspective of 
having affairs and how many people that effects and what those effects can 
be....the ripple never ends..﻿
The song that starts at 0:50 is '' Demon Host'' by Timber Timbre﻿
I loved sarah  polley in dawn of the dead, sad she got so old so quick.﻿
at 0:10 it's Paul Mottram - Endless 
I just watched this documentary/movie. It was absolutely brilliant. Diane 
will never die after this beautiful view into her past. When I see things 
like this I always feel it's such a shame that the person in question will 
not be around to see it.
What is the song that starts at 0:50?
the director mom was a really really bad person 
Not really sure there is a website or if there are screenings in Boston. 
You'd have to check out your local indie theatres. There's only limited 
screenings here in Canada, too.
Sarah Polley hasn't just reinvented the art form, she's come up with 
something so original and dumbfoundingly brilliant that it defies easy 
description. The most challenging film I've seen so far this year and also 
the most rewarding. The critic's groups would be well-served to include 
this film high, very high, on their year-end lists.
Sarah Polley is a complete original. If anyone ever has an interest in 
making a film about Joni Mitchell, it should be her.
This father and husband upheld every aspect of his commitment. Love is 
something that comes with many, many years. NPD is a good diagnosis for 
this mother and wife. Harry is a dysfunctional person...sleeping with a 
married woman; he probably felt like James Bond! Why don't you rob a bank 
or some other thing that requires legal and moral restraint...you can count 
up the money on camera beyond the statute of limitations and tell everyone 
how proud you are.

The Gatekeepers documentary trailer.﻿
this is disgusting﻿
and to think this documentary got selected for Oscar's , what a pathetic 
joke !! fucking murderers 
really, what else do you expect from somebody with the name iraqiboy90? He 
likely lived trought the whole massacre in his country from 2001 to 
nowadays as a teeneger and it is also likely that he is absolutely sure in 
that the whole war is happened because the state of Israel. Of course that 
country is not the real reason behind the Iraqi conflict but you cant argue 
against the leaders of his religion. And those leaders almost always blame 
some external forces for their internal problems. 
Israeli society and Israeli politics is very divided which is evident in 
the recent elections. If you saw the movie you would know that the Israeli 
left was defeated in the mid 1990s due to the assissination of Rabin and 
the eruption of suicide bombs in 1995. I would say that most Israel's are 
prepared to negotiate for peace, but don't feel that they have anybody to 
negotiate with. 
Zionism is a bigoted idealism, shedding the blood of gentiles in defense of 
the indefensible genocide of Palestinians. Just because Hollywood and 
western media is afraid to speak the truth don't, for a second, believe 
that humans are so easily misled. 
Great documentary....i think people must watch this. Crime of Israel on 
this World...wow, just wow. International court and justice must do 
something about Israel....
What the hell are you talking about? the Israeli politicians hate this 
movie, just 2 days ago the Israelli ambassador in the US was condeming the 
movie in the press Learn your facts!
my comment before has been deleted...why? are u zionist fear the truth?? u 
learn and ask your rabbai...learn the truth history..u will find who the 
hell u are...
whatever u say, eric cartman
I meant it as, every country surrounding Israel but if someone came to my 
backyard with tanks and assault rifles telling me that god meant it for 
them to inherit that land and set a kibbutz there, yeah I think I would be 
pretty pissed off.
Ahem, I believe it is Muslims who consider Jesus to be a prophet, and Jews 
who consider him an abomination...does swiss refer to the holes in your 
head?
No one with a religious belief has ever contributed anything positive 
towards the peaceful solution of the I-P conflict
what if i say im the gatekeeper, but what gate am i keeping or protecting? 
can u figure it out human?
@SlaveSociety totally agree with u friend...
From what I have read, the film is dispassionately neutral. It gives the 
interviews in the Shin Bet leaders words (and they can be candid), and 
leaves the audience to judge, somewhat like in Jesus Camp. Some people say 
it is anti-israel, others say it lets Israel off the hook too easy. I have 
to see it to judge.
if arab countries attack israel and fail,,,they can always fall back to 
their own lands.. israel is fighting for its existence.. if it fails, it 
gets pushed into the ocean..
the Romans killed Jesus
Funny thing is this documentary doesn't even seem to sugar-coat the evil of 
the Israeli state. It's gonna be like watching a documentary that 
interviews John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, Adolf Hitler, James 
Holmes, and Adam Lanza, with the thesis that "killing innocent people is a 
fantastic pastime that's healthy for the world."
watch?v=EC6C-cAc240
Jesus was jewish.
Very impressive erudition! Which university did you receive you doctorate 
from?
 I saw this movie a few days ago. Very engaging and intense, a powerful 
piece of work, Also very unexpected. I thought the six Shin Bet leaders 
would espouse the party line - these guys ARE the gatekeepers, after all - 
but they don't. Very surprising. 
"righting" ... how fucking ironic, you moron.

I feel like eating dolphin meat tonight. ﻿
Whales aren't fish, they're marine mammals.﻿
As much as I don't agree with Orca's being in captivity, people need to 
realise that this film consisted of 85% lies - major parts of this film are 
so factually inaccurate!﻿
I just saw the documentary and have never been to Seaworld anyways. I will 
not support that corrupt organization.﻿
A tale - A freedom spurned.
A whale, they named Tilikum.
A veil, as they hid and yearned -
A pail of just his cum.﻿
The fact of the matter is that whales, dolphins, or any animal out there 
shouldn't be put on display for our amusement. As the bible says, "God gave 
us the Garden of Eden to cultivate and care for it."﻿
I won't be supporting Sea World with my business anymore.﻿
This documentary movie really changed my perspective on the aquarium and 
even zoo captivity. It's horrible what they have-are doing to these 
innocent animals. I really feel such heart ache for Tillicum. I am never 
going to another aquarium, that's how much this documentary impacted me.﻿
I love how SeaWorld tries to do PR damage control with their own youtube 
video. I'd like to see how they explain the trainers killed and how locking 
up giant animals in a small cage is humane.﻿
This is the only film I know of that rendered an entire room of my friends 
into shocked silence for ten minutes.﻿
I understand to not do shows but it will take long process and the whale 
have to be committed if not  than everything is going to go horribly wrong 
. Well free willy for instance he was born on the wild and was not at an 
amuse my park for so long so because of the glass breaking they could of 
sent him to another amusement park but the his pod was close by and he 
knows the ocean. So I guess of everyone just focusing on killer whales look 
at dolphins seals belugas etc. ......﻿
Ha and it's funny too that Seaworld never showed commercials until after 
Blackfish ha ha...﻿
I love it but I think you missed mention to Keiko due to USA took it from 
Mexico and never accepted that died because they let her free and she never 
was able to live in the ocean again, no longer than 2 months. 
She was a quiet whale but all the people decided to give her freedom. So... 
why don't they did the same thing with the ones that you mention here. It's 
obvious that they couldn't make it as Keiko didn't too. ﻿
you are a bunch of fukin pussies, who cares about fukin whales u damn 
potheads cunts﻿
how could you josh﻿
It's sick that people actually go pay money to see an animal being forced 
to do something they don't want! Leave them where they belong! They're not 
hurting anyone, that industry is hurting them! It's sick how they treat 
them, I will never ever pay money to sea world or any other industry that 
treats animals like that! ﻿
they're are two sides to each story﻿
If you cried watching Blackfish you will harpoon a japanese fisherman when 
you watch The Cove .﻿
After watching Blackfish, I feel this disbelief inside that we as humans, 
these highly evolved beings with the capacity to change and shape our world 
do not feel a moral dilemma as a whole in using our powers to subjugate our 
kin, a majestic species we inhabit this planet with for mere entertainment. 
#barbaric #stopseaworld   #blackfish  ﻿
I just can not believe how MEAN and DISGUSTING human beings can be to make 
money!

Reducing decades of volunteer and careful work of SeaWorld team to make a 
Blockbuster? 

This is unbelievable!!!! This is SOOOOOO UNBELIEVABLE!!!!

SeaWorld is the ONLY particular organization WHO CARES and do anything to 
save animals around the world, just for their passion to animals.
And the business monster want to destroy even this.

I'm just speechless… 
Please, don't even try to reply if you are not in the scene, aka if you are 
not qualified to answer. If you are not biologist, if you are not activist, 
if you are not on the animal rescue scene.

Haters? please…..﻿
I hope everybody die...... you have no right to train an animal....... just 
imagine that you are in a jail doing tricks for the animals.....

Stupids humans....﻿
The Killer_whale_attacks_on_humans article on Wikipedia is an eye-opener, 
attacks on trainers by Orcas have been happening since the 1970s!
Lions have also attacked trainers at circus performances, I guess we need a 
scary movie on that as well to get people motivated to stop this form of 
entertainment, or maybe a death is necessary. Then again so long as enough 
money is exchanging hands this kind of thing will go on.﻿
watched this movie today, loved the black of the orcas.. reminded me of how 
lovely black leather looks when wet but lets get to the point. the point is 
the owners of SeaWorld along with the trainers should be arrested for the 
bestiality practices on Tilicum. You clearly see in the movie as they jerk 
his giant pink orca penis which squirts loads of seaman. That's something 
kids shouldn't be subjected to at a family park.﻿
I watched it and I cried when they separated the babies from their mothers 
specially. I have been to SeaWorld only once, but never have or will again.

And after the revolution and the blood spilled of many dreamers for a 
better Egypt, still the poverty and chaos reigns.﻿
This is now available on Netflix in Canada, I don't know about America but 
probably.  The world will watch and will continue to wait to realize the 
freedom of the people of Egypt.  ﻿
same thing is happening now in venezuela ﻿
Laura where did you watch it?﻿
if we stop the aid while a revolution is ongoing then please every country 
rise up so we can keep our money finally,we the average people dont give a 
fuck what happens in Egypt,in fact if you guys would all die that would be 
the best so we can use that land the way it meant to be used not like you 
dogs use it today "ahhh the tourism is dead and we don't want to work so 
lets change the government again.....ill ilah " sick of the middle east it 
is always some shit with you mother fuckers like others got no problems,fix 
your own trash people or die out already and that goes for all of you out

fuck off  ﻿
You need to watch this god bless all peace loving people .our governments 
use us to do their dirty work . Their is good in all people Christian and

people that rule by it god bless all of you﻿
From the 2011 overthrow of a 30-year dictator, through military rule, and 
culminating with the forced military removal of the Muslim Brotherhood 
president in the summer of 2013, we follow a group of Egyptian activists as 
they battle leaders and regimes, and risk their lives to build a new 
society of conscience. 

The Egyptian Revolution has been an ongoing roller coaster. Through the 
news, we only get a glimpse of the bloodiest battle, an election, or a 
million-man march. At the beginning of August 2013, we witnessed the second 
president deposed within the space of three years.

THE SQUARE is a truly immersive experience, transporting the viewer deeply 
into the intense emotional drama and personal stories behind the news. It 
is the inspirational story of young people claiming their rights, 
struggling through multiple forces: from a brutal army dictatorship willing 
to crush protesters with military tanks, to a corrupt Muslim Brotherhood 
using mosques to manipulate voters. THE SQUARE continues to wow audiences 
and critics as the winner of the Sundance 2013 Audience Award and the 
Audience Award at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival.

As the revolution continues in Egypt and around the globe, the theatrical 
release of THE SQUARE is right on time to keep the dialogue going.﻿
Obviously the Egyptian people have OVERWHELMINGLY rejected the Muslim 
Brotherhood... I hope this documentary depicts this fact accurately or it's 
doing a great disservice to the Egyptian people﻿
Well, it's a great movie and great honour however, the army did what is 
needed to be done to protect Egypt and to make peace it was never a treason 
or whatever the idea is.﻿
Heart touching! #DubaiMatchmaker   #MyOrient  ﻿
Where to watch it in Egypt, or over the Internet﻿
Please watch the video that explains who's really behind all the current 
regime changes in so many countries (so called "revolutions" and "Arab 
Spring" among others.)  It's a European organization backed by the US 
government and it's corporate backers. See it here on YouTube under the 
title "Does the USA sponsor revolutions?" Just copy/paste that title in the 
YouTube search bar.﻿
can anyone tell me which songs they used in the trailer?﻿

Egyptian army sucks....they are criminals﻿
Just Saw This On Netflix…. Brilliant Film…. It Shows You Just How Powerful 
The Citizen Of A Country Can Be……. ﻿
It's a shame that all this was for nothing in the end (up till this point 
at least). It's still the same regime but stronger and more oppressive now. 
What's sad is that the people basically handed over the country back to 
them on a silver platter. We are much further away from freedom and 
democracy than we were in 2011. We all know that dictatorship has very 
strong roots in Egypt, but apparently it's not just with the dictators, but 
also with the people. ﻿
This better be true and not any propaganda crap, cause it really looks good.
I saw the film last night and highly recommend it to everyone, teenagers 
included, who want to understand what is happening in Egypt. It is 
relevant, current, and inspiring. I wonder if I would be as brave as the 
regular people who took to the streets to bring freedom to their country.

Shame on your ignorance Uganda. Ready for lynching? ﻿
Killing homosexuals is not apart of Christianity at ALL. Jesus Christ did 
not shed his blood for heterosexuals only. He knew some people would be gay

Cross. To feel His love.﻿
Call Me Kuchu is out in 2 days! See the incredible doc following LGBT 
activists in Uganda with us Friday: ﻿
An abolutely riveting documentary that must be seen. It puts a face on our 
oppressed brothers and sisters in Uganda. A deeply moving and unforgettable 
account of what rampant homophobia can do. But also, a story of hope.
I wanna watch this movie so bad, but its not being showed in my country.. =(
The movie tells that part of the tale quite well. Thank goodness.
At the start of this doc it says. That 95% of Ugandans are against 
homosexuality,, yet we know 10% of any human population is gay. For those 
who think it's not natural watch HOW TO CONFUSE A CREATIONIST: EVOLUTION 
HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE BIBLE
fight has just began folks, keep strong......
Pretty sure these dumb Ugandan's that oppose homosexuality and other stuff 
should be taken out, they are just too dumb to change.
If you mean that it's disgusting to treat anyone the way that they treat 
gay people in Uganda then I agree, it is disgusting.
fight has just began folks, keep strong......
I saw this film last week. It was s sad. I cried so much, and I felt so 
lucky to live were I live, with the rights that I do. Please watch it if 
you can!

Maybe people should have stopped trying to "Stop Kony" and focus on the 
atrocious Ugandan government that will kill people just because of who they 
are/
Please do accept my apology. I meant to say "annoying prick".
Ohhhhh, loooook, everyone- a troll on YouTube. How very original.
yuck!!! disgusting!
Really happy to be a moron also? I sure u didn't even saw the film
And the saddest thing is that the American Evangelicals are the reason this 
thing is happening.. They say homosexuality is a west thing, but really the 
kill the gays is a "west thing"

this is the sound city trailer, rick, paul mccartney, stevie nicks, and tom 
petty aren't really in the trailer much but they're some of the main 
 people in the movie   #awesomemovie  ﻿
*Sound City*
This documentary really grabbed me. I don't recall ever having heard 
of/about Sound City but as a small-town DJ during the 70s and early 80s, I 
played a lot of the music that was recorded in this historic studio. The 
film had a nifty technical angle (analog vs digital recording) while 
capturing that mysterious energy/connection/whatever that happens when 
talented musicians get together in a studio and start playing/recording. 

I really liked the final segment with Paul McCartney. The film's director, 
Dave Grohl, says to McCartney (his idol), "Why can't it always be this 
easy?" ...to which Sir Paul replies, "It is. It is." You probably have to 
see the film for that to make sense. This was obviously a work of love by 
all who worked on/appeared in the documentary. I highly recommend.﻿
Just watched this movie! I REALLY want to record something now! And I 
REALLY want to meet Dave Grohl! And hey, why not record it at his studio? 
;-)﻿
FINALLY watched the #music #documentary Sound City - it's wonderful!
http://ow.ly/uhZIM﻿
I jus watched this earlier. Phenomenal movie. I'm a sucker for music 
documentaries like this and enjoyed every minute of it. Makes me wish I was 
a musician in the 70s or the 90s and got exposure to analog recording like 
all these guys did.

If you love music history and music recording, go see this now.﻿
its not about analogue or digital ........its about music........playing a 
tune into mic and saying its real its the best...The Beatles chopped, 
spliced, looped, double tracked and would have used digital to achieve this 
if it was there at the time.........its about originality and 
talent........long live rock n roll﻿
who else hates this digital era﻿
need/want to see this!﻿
But if you watch the movie, you see that you really CAN'T do this 
digitally.  You aren't going to recreate the moments or the special sound 
quality of that particular studio and sound board.  Are we resigned to more 
people making more music but none of it sounding as good as it used to?  
I'm not.﻿
I think they go totally overboard with this whole "sound like people" 
thing, just because it's analog and stuff. Some people just don't have the 
budget to record either at Sound City or at any other analog recording 
studio. I can't afford it, and also I record a lot of my own one-man bands 
(drums, guitar, bass, vocals), and being able to do a lot of takes with all 
instruments on a PC with digital DAWs is almost necessary to get what I 
want. Is it "less human" because of that? I don't think so. I still play 
all instruments and do what I can afford and what makes me do what I wanna 
accomplish. If I could afford all-analog hardware and stuff; I would take 
that rout, no question asked. But it's expensive... Even just getting a 
tape recorder and basic mixer is too pricey for me, and then add good 
quality tapes to that...

Record all-out analog is as cool as it can be, but analog elitism is NOT 
cool. Anything is good as long as it sounds good ;)﻿
MUSIC PORN﻿
Perhaps a better approach would be - instead of letting the studio go to 
the wall, that some of these multi-millionaire rock stars give a tiny tiny 
little bit back and keep the studio on its feet. Just the combined wealth 
of Stevie Nicks, Dave Grohl, Trent Reznor and Rick Rubin must run into 
BILLIONS!

Instead they chose to let it go to the wall and then cherry pick the best 
gear fro their won private studios. Watching the desk go out the window was 
like watching cultural vandalism at it's worst.

Christ-  Fleetwood Mac and Rumours would never have come about without 
Sound City as well as Never Mind and Killing In the Name. How much revenue 
did that generate!

In 50-100 years time the studio will be gone, as well as a piece of unique 
America cultural heritage - but the film of it being stripped of its gear 
by millionaires will live forever. Tragic I say﻿
What pisses me off about this documentary is that they didn't include Nick 
Cave in it. Especially since Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds went in the studio 
to record the album "Henry's Dream" just after Nirvana recorded Nevermind. 
So that made me want to know why Dave didn't include one of the greatest 
songwriters living today.﻿
Mick Fleetwood from the Movie "Sound City"... 

The problem is people think they can do all this by themselves. Well they 
can. But if they did it together their lives would be so much better. 
(paraphrased a bit)

A wonderful concept in the technological modern age. Amazing documentary!﻿

Peter Staley, the infamous character in, How to survive a Plague, was 
supposedly diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and is oddly... still alive today. 
All his friends had AZT symptoms and deaths... and he is still alive 
screaming, HIV epidemic!? Weird﻿
Two years ago I tested positive for HIV while I felt 100% fit and healthy 
and over the last several months that changed. I became very weak and tired 
and began developing infections. I was put on ARV's Ritonivir, Darunivir 
and Truvada. Now I sleep 8 hours a night instead of 14, don't take naps, 
the infections are gone and I am looking for work and have started back in 
class. To all you AIDS denialists out there, FUCK OFF. Go get the infection 
yourself you pig ignorant fuckers before acting like you know anything. 
Damn internet wannabe academics.﻿
THIS IS WHAT REALLY HAPPEN! GOD BLESS ACT UP AND THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT GIVE 
UP!!﻿
One day, future scholars will look back… knowing that a virus called HIV 
never caused the "syndrome" AIDS. Poppers (Amyl Nitrites) which is a toxic 
sex drug used predominantly by gay men in the early 80s caused the two main 
illnesses, kaposi's sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia… which were lumped 
together and called AIDS. Rarely do people get these illnesses any longer, 
so the original AIDS illnesses are not happening right now. However the CDC 
put over 30 NEW illnesses into the syndrome to bring in more patients under 
the 300 billion dollar AIDS umbrella. This is a GIANT disease paradigm 
fraud, based on lies, propaganda, and many many more lies. ﻿
@blantha01 - what are you talking about?﻿
Mark Harrington, Peter Staley and Jim Eigo; 3 Main Characters in the 
popular AIDS Activist documentary: How to survive a Plague, all claimed to 
have a killer virus called HIV, and/or AIDS. 30 years later these men are 
still alive shouting pandemic? Does anyone else see something very wrong 
with this picture?﻿
One of the most compelling documentaries I have ever seen!!!﻿
Your beliefs are rather extreme. Yes, responsible sex can prevent the 
spread of aids. But what if you were raped and got aid? Or just born with 
it? Should those people also receive not treatment. We all make mistakes, 
but no one should have to die for them. 
gay, straight, old, young, all races, male, female: ALL are human being. 
ALL can get AIDS. These people who fought for a cure are HEROES. Enough said
Looks very exciting and informative! We have come a long way!
You think gay is unnatural? You know homosexual behaviour has been proven 
to occur in over 1500 different species of animal, right?
Now this comment is so far from the actual truth, it does not just kill gay 
people, there is no gay gene for it to target, a bad blood transfusion and 
you could get it, women have been raped and gotten it that way, so not only 
do gay people get this horrible sickness, junkies get it as well any one 
can get this sickness, not just people who enjoy same sex sexual 
experiences.
Yeah, there's no moral judgment in calling AIDS a symptom of a 
"debaucherous and decadent society." Whatever you say. 
Absolutely incorrect
Why do people think that only gays get aids? anyone can get it. :|
Its possibly because there is a THEORY that aids originated from gay sex, 
however as I aforementioned, this is a theory, and there isn't a whole lot 
of weight behind it. Mostly I think its because those people are 
uninformed, homophobic, ignorant assholes who don't actually know the first 
think about AIDS or homosexuality but would like to pretend they are 
experts who happen to be superior because their sexual preference means 
they can't get AIDS. Which, is frankly, bullshit. But such is life. 
you don't know that. There is at least 1 person immune
I'm astounded by this comment. Blown away even. I'm confused at how anyone 
could possibly argue that AIDS doesn't exist. Go visit Lesotho (the small 
country within South Africa) where AIDS has ravaged and killed thousands of 
people, including children. Your ignorance is appalling, disturbing and 
saddening. For all of the people who have seen it first hand, I hope you 
educate yourself before making such ridiculous comments.
So, in that essence, you're saying that if someone gets cancer from 
smoking, they shouldn't have the option of treatment or a potential cure? 
They should live and die without any hope of getting better because it's 
not the government's responsibility? That's a pretty harsh belief system 
you have there. 
What's the music???
I finished to watched this film. It was not only about AIDS and sexual 
orientation. It was about human right and fighting for your right. Omg! 
after I watched it, I really want to get involved in some activist group 
like environmental, immigration, animal right, domestic violence...ext. 
Please watch it before you misjudge the film. 
you are a great example of why anonymity on the internet causes a downfall 
in terms of quality commenting.
Nope, it came from men in close contact with bushmeat (from apes, most 
likely chimpanzees or the african green monkey). It only spread faster in 
the gay community, which is how it came to be associated with gays in the 
1980s, but it also has always been spread via heterosexual sex.
people get stds from more than just sex obviously do some research 
ok, so instead of creating a flame war. why don't you simply state your 
sources so we can share your wisdom if we wish to do so?

That's what is so ironic about all these people talking shit about Romney. 
Our hospitals already look like this & you want to add more people to 
system, de-incentify healthcare jobs by reducing reimbursements, 
controlling services and procedures to ration care (not a talking point, 
rationing care must happen with Obamacare).We do have problems with our 
healthcare system but dirty lobbyist and government influence is why it is 
so bad, with Regs that suppress free market pressures on cost.

government control every part of our lives because it is the only way we

Oh yeah blunts dk? I'm not a redneck and I'm 27 years old and I bet I'm a 
lot better lookin than u are. That's exactly how those three killers got 
out of jail. People assuming they know.
Crazy? Crazy is believing that these three kids who already confessed, 
didn't have anything to do with this murder. If u are in jail u have all 
the time in the world to try and think of a way to get out. Once hbo got 
involved the rest is history. Just think for one second, what if they did 
do it, and they fooled everyone including hbo. Body language says a lot. 
And u think it's crazy because I think this? Quit rippin off quotes from

end of the docu, trying to convince himself abt the alford plea...saying 
they are guilty. what a 42 carat mofo. ive not heard anyone speak such BS 
in my life. i hope he dies

knew they fucked up and were in to deep so PRIDE prevented them from 
admitting to that. what cunts they really are. cant wait to see west of

thanks for the tip but already seen them, they left such a mark in me and I 
then saw this new one and it got me curious... some new interview footage 
and more explanations..
hey. I totally get it. I have followed this since it started. I follow him 
on twitter and sometimes exchange comments. He's a cutie, like I thought he 
would be. Im very impressed. And I cant stop loving him as a person. Theres 
just always been something about him that was extreme and it had nothing to 
do with WM3. He is an extraordinary person, to me. But everyone has their 
own taste in people and what they like. Damien and me have everything in 
common, and I dont like calming down, its way fun!
whats the song called when it reaches 2:23? 
alright! thanks for reply, can`t wait
this is another version of paradise lost
scumbag judge
So true, the guys a clear sociopath. He makes my skin crawl. I wanted to 
believe he is innocent but his "character" or act betrays him. I'm sad so 
many people are fooled by him.

 WHY HAS THERE BEEN A HUSH? I never heard of this film and there are major 
mega executive producers, Danny Glover, John Legend and Russel 
Simmons...........how did the this film go under the radar.......and why is 
it my friend that lives in England had to tell me about this AMERICAN DOC!﻿
The documentary is a joke. We should find a different way to combat drug 
addiction and NOTHING IS FREE, this documentary isn't free, youtube isn't 
free, etc so of coarse people are going to profit off imprisoning people 
who brake the law.﻿
Worth repeating like a gazillion times "the Drug War is a holocaust in slow 
motion"﻿
This is a very informative, educational documentary that I watched and took 
in from both perspectives, the underprivileged and the law.... Leave me 
asking many questions but without any answers :(﻿
It's funny how the people who believe that being born poor in an urban 
ghetto effectively predetermines you to become a drug dealer are usually 
the same people who would never accept an excuse by, say, an investment 
bank selling credit default swaps or securitized mortgages that they were 
forced into that business by onerous taxes and regulations that made more 
traditional, less risky investments unprofitable.

They'll make excuses for all of the recipients of those taxes - who have 
received trillions of dollars in welfare over the decades (and stagnated in 
spite of it) - but never for the (eventual, inevitable) bad behavior of the 
people who paid all of the taxes (and who have - "somehow" - managed to 
grow and prosper in spite of it)﻿

Complementary to the previous documentary I posted about the drug affair, 
have a look to this one:﻿
﻿
The war on drugs is a disgrace. Marijuana should have been legal years ago. 
The law enforcement people are making big money incarcerating good average 
honest hard working Americans for smoking pot. This is a tragic shame. 
.America now has more people in prison than any other country in the world. 
It is no longer the land of the free. As a war veteran it turns my stomach 
to think I fought for this country which punishes people in order to profit 
from it.﻿
The war on drugs - punishing the sad, black and poor. ﻿
The War on Drugs has been a complete Failure!! We need to treat Drugs as a 
Public Health Issue not a Criminal Justice Issue!  Locking up people for 
drug possession changes nothing. Lets offer counseling and or rehab, those 
type of things. Putting somebody behind bars does not make addiction go 
away!﻿
THE WAR ON DRUGS IN AMERICA...﻿
Prohibition has failed.  Again.﻿
Must see!﻿
Drug use fascinates me. I like the biological and chemical aspects of 
drugs, but the sociological and psychological aspects are just as 
interesting. This documentary looks into the societal effects of an economy 
based in regulating drug use and how detrimental it is. But I ask, what can 
you do now? The system is in place now, so how do we make a systemic 
change?﻿
This is a must - highly recommend to watch this.﻿
Worthwhile, informative, and perhaps mind changing. ﻿

of why the war on drugs is far more harmful to society than drugs 
themselves could ever be.﻿

I just saw the Central Park Five today. a truly sad story of these 
wrongfully convicted men. ﻿
I just finished watching The Central Park Five. I remember when this 
happened and when it got overturned. Ken Burns does it again. This is also 
a tragic yet poignant cautionary tale to watch with your young teenagers.﻿
Must See Movie﻿
I wished the evil bitch prosecutor who coerced them youngsters would eat 
Shit and die. She will definitely go to he'll. ﻿
The biggest mystery in this crime was why this woman was jogging in Central 
Park late at night.
I mean, I am not suggesting in any way that she deserved to be brutalized. 
But 1989 was the bad old days in NYC. This was the pre-Giuliani period when 
the Democrats had absolute power in the city. Needless to say, NYC was a 
dark, scary and dangerous crime-ridden place. No sane person would be 
hanging out in Central Park at night in 1989 (it was dangerous enough being 
there during the day). For a petite young woman to go for a run late at 
night in Central Park in 1989 was extremely reckless and borderline 
suicidal.﻿
where can i watch it, this trailer is 2 years old﻿
What a powerful documentary ﻿
Woow...I've NEVER heard about this but i will find this movie!﻿
﻿
Music from trailer!? Anyone know the title!?﻿
haha. yup. cuz rikers island saved their lives. okie dokie.﻿
they were guilty of something, just not this crime.  Society most likely 
was free of 5 would be criminals who were locked up until they were 
adults.  Look at them now.  None of them are involved in any Vice.
Were their lives ruined?  In the slums of NYC in the 80s and 90s, most 
likely not.

I feel sorry that kids were wrongly accused but they never became gang 
bangers.﻿
it was Patrick Bateman﻿
THE CENTRAL PARK FIVE, a new film from award-winning filmmaker Ken Burns, 
tells the story of the five black and Latino teenagers from Harlem who were 
wrongly convicted of raping a white woman in New York City’s Central Park 
in 1989. The film chronicles The Central Park Jogger case, for the first 
time from the perspective of these five teenagers whose lives were upended 
by this miscarriage of justice. The Police forced kids to lie to make 
themselves look good. Crazy.﻿
One of the most carefully constructed documentaries I've ever seen and also 
one of the most harrowing.﻿

Excellent doco , just finished watching it. ﻿
Its a shame that this shit is still happening in 2013, all around the 
world. It happened to me a couple of weeks ago and its absolutely no fun to 
go to jail for something you have nothing to do with. Since that day I live 
my life with 1 rule, the only time Ill have a court-date will b on the 
street with my 9.﻿
im not shocked since this type of miscarriage of justice happens all the 
time, especially to minorities. how the judge even let this go to trial is 
unbelievable. where was child services? their attorneys were incompetent. 
how the jury were unanimous is just unbelievable. never mind dirty cops n 
the DA since u expect that from them. how the confession tapes were 
admissible when they didn't have proper representation is beyond me. I hope 
each one of them get $500M judgement﻿
﻿
@Guy Senjem- something has perverted your view of reality so much that you 
are convinced that blacks have never suffered injustice. Blacks do commit 
crimes, true, but you take that view to the extreme. You have to temper 
your views with the fact that, in this country of capitalism, those with 
out financial means will not get the full benefits of this justice and 
black people often fall into this category.
I'm going to be seeing this documentary in a prison with some inmates I 
teach. I think it will be interesting to discuss with them. 
they were put through over 24 hours of nonstop psychological torture. the 
pigs methodically broke down their defenses and reduced them to a state of 
complete hopelessness and despair. at that point they were willing to say 
anything just to get the torture to stop. the false confessions were the 
prosecution's only evidence. there was one person's dna and that guy has 
confessed on his own out of guilt. its easy to find 12 idiots as gullible 
as you to convict.

Watched this last night. Visually magnificent and immensely moving. While 
breathtaking to watch, as a citizen of this planet I felt both horror and 
dismay. In the face of this compelling evidence, I have only 2 questions to 
the ludicrous naysayers: What harm could possibly result in cleaning up 
this planet and amending our destructive ways; and finally, if we continue 
on our destructive path, just what is Plan B?﻿

My grandma practically raised me. I never thought about her life before she

I am grateful for that every day. Otherwise my mother, family, and myself

back then... and he created just as amazingly great Men and Women the sort 
of whom we don't see anymore these days. They were the carriers of life.

You didn't get it. They are jews and she was a nazi. How is that even 
posible? O_O
This film is NOT about "The Holocaust." It is about genealogy, about how 
personal relations and group relations can be on one hand completely 
amicable while the other is in drastic, dealy conflict. This film is about 
German people -- some Jews, some not; some Zionists, some not; some NaZis, 
most not. And this film is about their ancestors, some German citizens, 
some Israelis. 
Want to see this
I like the violin part in the trailer
Actually looks really interesting. Looking forward into watching it.
I dont dictate what movies are being made i am just saying this has been 
done to death and numbed me of from what actually happened. I simply dont 
care about it anymore.
huh...

Try focusing on some other 50 million killed in other tragic events. Its 
been done to death, sorry
11 years since the Twin Tower fell, could we move on from that?
That's why this is so compelling. If you look closer there seems to be a 
link between some Nazi's and Jews who are Zionist. (means the establishment 
of a Jewish state and the keeping of it), that's funny because the jews got 
their state because of ww2, and tthen that coin here, it has swastika, and 
6 pointed star, how? Then in german it says "Ein Nazi Farth" basically 
means a Nazi travels, and the country was Palestine the Nazi's traveled 
too. Then coincidentally that's where the Jews migrate

The gentleman, after being asked, (this is a paraphrase)'You don't think 
dinosaurs and people lived at the same time, do you?" says, "Sure I do! 
They were on the arc together." Okay, after I compose myself for a few 
minutes, I want to dissect all the things wrong with that...[breath, just 
breath]...alright First of,... [nope hands still shaking in fury].. Okay... 
First, it's never mentioned in the bible that dinosaurs exist, and it's 
especially never states that they were on the arc with Noah.
I had a preacher tell me once, "If you take a bottle of water and put 
different kinds of dirt in it, then you shake it, the layers will form all 
on their own as they settle." I know that due to the physics of weight and 
buoyancy that it's not impossible that might be true. The problem is that 
the layers of Earth's crust aren't divided by the physics of weight and 
buoyancy. Instead, they are divided by the regional plant-life, the time 
spent under water, the atmospheric particulate that settled on that patch 
of land, and various other things. Not weight and buoyancy. Meaning that if 
it were just, "Earth was flooded and stirred up all the dirt, then you get 
various layers!" there is no explanation for why they formed the way they 
have. Unless that the pattern we see in the crust comes from different 
sediment and ecology laying on top of other types.  So, that means that the 
most likely explanation is that the layers are divided by time.  Which 
should lead you to conclude, that since dinosaurs and humans are definitely 
not found at the same time as each other in the fossil record, that we are 
likely never going to find that they cohabited the planet.
Another flaw in the "Dinosaurs and humans lived together!" theory (I use 
the general speech version of 'theory' not the scientific one that means 
'so close to proven its almost a fact', but the one that means 
'conjecture'), the Hebrew word that is used to say "Earth" in the Noah 
story, is the same word that is used for any large quantity of land. So, 
there isn't even proof in the Bible that God flooded the whole Earth.
I want people to have faith and I want that faith to brings them peace and 
happiness. I wish I had that faith myself. There are reasons I don't. The 
biggest reason is the logical conclusions you have to ignore to say, "God 
did it." I don't think this gentleman and his beliefs are able to coexist 
with his position, just like dinosaurs and man.﻿
What happened in Texas is utterly sickening, it is like stepping education 
back 150-200 years.  The use of the word "theory" is also widely misused by 
those not in the scientific community, Einstein's Theory of Relativity is a 
great example.  Theory is based upon extensive research and scientific 
evidence to back up the claim!  My "theory" is that most people will make 
it to work tomorrow, this theory is easily backed because most people will 
make it to work tomorrow.  There is a wealth of evidence that most people 
will make it to work tomorrow (your own experience should back this claim 
up).  Einstein's Theory of Relativity is also easily proved, just look at 
the effects of an atomic weapon, little mass can release great amounts of 
energy.  The "Theory of Evolution" is no different, there is a huge amount 
of evidence available that supports it.  What makes more sense, natural 
selection or magic, pixie dust and fairy tales?  I am 44 years old and have 
never personally observed any pixies, unicorns, magical fairies, witches, 
warlocks and the such...Science is based upon proof, observation and 
evidence, not blind faith.  I would love to see a T-Rex on the "Ark"! 
 Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, end of story!   ﻿
These morons are what you get when you believe that somehow the bible is a 
science document.﻿
lol @ liberals that refuse to read the mayflower compact to find out why 
this country was founded and on who's principles it was founded on﻿
meanwhile liberals are in chicago are trying to sell lincoln as a democrat. 
whos rewriting history, again? the problem with the left is they cant 
debate on the grounds of morals because they know what their own party 
stands for. instead they resort to inaccurate documentaries like this and 
name calling. prove me wrong.﻿
We're in BIG trouble unless we do something about this, and FAST.﻿
I'm watching a documentary today called The Revisionaries (on Netflix), 
about the revised text books in Texas schools.

I swing between screaming at the TV and laughing my ass off that people 
would actually do this. As a historian, I DO NOT support this type of 
revisionary teaching and it worries me greatly that children outside of 
Texas will have their education affected because of a well-meaning 
Christian agenda in TX.

I'm a Joe Friday type of woman; "just the facts, ma'am."﻿
Now available on Netflix, this documentary about the 
creationist/revisionist takeover of the Texas school board:﻿
This isn't coming to a theater near me and I'm sad.﻿
A new horror movie is making the rounds on the festival circuit. Well, not 
a horror movie in the traditional sense. It's a documentary about the Texas 
State Board of Education's attempt to revise history and science curricula 
to promote creationism and far-right politics. If you remember from a few 
years ago, this was the group led by a dentist who said that "someone has 
to stand up to the experts." And they set education standards for Texas.

For example, they suggested removing Thomas Jefferson and having students 
study Thomas Acquinas. Or to have students study the weaknesses of 
evolution. Since Texas is such a large state which buys so many textbooks, 
Texas' standards affect the rest of the country.

So, essentially, a horror movie. Can't wait until it's out on DVD.

More info here: http://www.therevisionariesmovie.com/﻿
Just back from the walk home from *The Revisionaries*. It was definitely 
worth the time.

It's a film about what happened when the Texas Textbook massacre ensued by 
the young earth creationists who ended up running the Board of Education 
review process. It was definitely creepy. It was scary. But it needs to be 
seen. 

I'll have a longer review when I have a chance to write it up (tomorrow, I 
hope). But if you have a chance you should try to see it at film festivals 
near you.﻿
This would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.  #Dangerous #Ignorance 
#Education (or lack thereof.)﻿
Heading out in a little while to see *The Revisionaries*. 

I'm afraid it's going to be hard to watch. But it has to be done.﻿
you pick your own side.
Looks like a sequel to "Jesus Camp". Scary shit.
And gay people. 
religion is a choice,stop picking on young minds you CUNTS
Can Texas just secede already?!
schools are for knowledge to teach science and facts. churches are to teach 
kids the religion their parents chose them to believe. evolution can help 
teach kids on how to be doctors. but were i am Canadian living in a 
multicultural country, you learn there are more to your world then the 
narrow minded tunnel were the idiots belong. 
No... this is just a badly done trailer. Have seen 2 trailer, this one look 
like it could be a rally cry for creationist. If it wasn't for a quote by 
Michael Moore... I couldn't tell where it was leaned... had to switch my 
vote twice before settling on like. The 2nd trailer I saw was slightly 
better.
America should be a progressive nation, and in order for it to progress 
religion should be excluded from the government. We are a nation where many 
people from different cultures and religions come here to stay, and to just 
impose christian values in the education of American children is just 
prejudice. Science is not a leftist biased ideology, it is a non biased 
practice of research, OF TRUTH. Stop the religious indoctrination! 
I wonder sometimes what group or system is actually in power/more involved 
in these matters. Politics or Religion? or do they go hand in hand when 
they ought to be separate.
Could just go to church.. but no, lets stir up a hornets nest.
Its sad that these people are in charge of educating our kids. It is these 
people to blame for the downfall of this nation, by replacing science with 
mythology and overturning actual history for their comic book version of it.

My Uncle is there right now. Please pray for him thank you. Haven't seen or

What would we call this Royal documentary with me and Prince William and 
Prince Harry and Princess Catherine Middleton?

Yeah I have my own title.  Im already hated by the church.

We made decisions at the top that impacted society at the bottom, including 
political debates around the world.  Im not into politics everyone already 
knows this on the planet.  We are the newer generation that's going to be 
leadership.

 Rise of the Dark Prince???  I got it from Edward the Black Prince of 
Wales. ﻿
Finally getting a chance to watch this on Netflix...﻿
If they make me into a documentary with Prince William, its worth the watch 
over this.  Why?  Youre going to see Prince William speak his mind with 
Princess Catherine Middleton.  And if youre British, you know that Royals 
aren't mean like that or to say stuff like this.  THEY JUST DID.  WELCOME 
TO REALITY.

While they talk about drama of politics and how people feel about each 
other around  the world.  They might talk about the drama they went through 
at the top raised on throne.  Its pretty fucked up because Im against it 
too and I live in the USA, not a citizen of the Commonwealth.  If you live 
in the usa this is like having the President of the USA speak his mind how 
he feels about everything and what he wants to do and what he did to the 
people that they didn't know.  THATS WHAT THE ROYALS MIGHT TALK ABOUT IF 
THEY MAKE THIS INTO A DOCUMENTARY.

It will probably just be Prince William and Princess Catherine in the 
palace or something watching something on tv with people around the world, 
civil unrest and so on or humanitarian aide then he changed the channel to 
the usa where people are living a dream and talking about politics and 
religion and end of the world.  Another Prince who lives in the usa never 
knew he was a Prince use to have a normal life and socialize with people in 
society till he got screwed over by society.  Yeah its me.  Im talking 
about stuff out loud because I hear voices in my head and I know the Govt. 
can hear me talking.  That's why Im like this.﻿
If I was in a documentary movie.  Its about how I grew up and turned out.  
I was a Prince in disguise and never knew.  The others were talking too on 
tv without me knowing about it and made decisions in their country while I 
sat on the computer and getting fat and can hear voices in my head.  I 
don't do a damn thing now that I hear this shit going on.  People in 
society should of just told me whats going on to get the GOOD ENDING.  
There is no good ending.  Just an ending with me waking up to reality, a 
reality where I got screwed over by people in society.  I did time in 
military too, Im glad those who knew me spoke their mind.﻿
Look at this shit.  These guys are heroes to the usa.  I don't want some 
cheese dick documentary about me like this.  I don't want to be in some 
movie either.  How do you think this soldier feels like now that's talking 
about hes been on about 4 of 5 different pills and got labeled with PTSD?  
Youre a fucking war hero.  Be proud of the USA.  Preach democracy.﻿
This looks better than The Hurt Locker George Bush = idiot He could never 
do what these guys do
most intense and amazing documentary i've ever seen by far
Amazing documentary. It's sad but it really opens your eyes to what these 
guys go through and sacrifice everyday. Don't listen to @Alok kimbo, he's a 
disrespectful cunt.
This film provides insight into what is happening a world away, and 
presents a surreal view of the pressures emotionally and physically that 
our soldiers experience. Documentaries that set out to show the world as it 
is are the most influential. I recently saw Programming the Nation?, and in 
that film they were able to expose the realities of subliminal messaging in 
broadcasting and publishing. The media will no longer have a hold on our 
minds in the way it has for years, bitly .com/oQ0ZVk. 
Most of the time the army never gets the credit or respect we deserve I 
rember most of my friends In high school wanted to join the marines cuz of 
their uniform n movies like full metal jacket meanwhile since I join the 
army I see a lot marines switching to the army n am like is that your 
semper fi , nonetheless I give my respects to all the service members of 
our military hooa ! May God be with u at all times
agree. Awesome book. And i even hate books.
@thegei MY uncle was special forces aviation in the army and one of the 
first units in afghanistan, so ya I have a lot of respect for the army in 
that way, and also I have the respect for them knowing that they, on 
occasion fight worse firefights then marines, but the pacific theatre is 
what gave me my respect for the marines. So what it was 60 yrs ago, the 
fighting they did on Iwo Jima, Gaudalcanal, and new Britain inspired me to 
want to join the marines.
I'm in the British army and theres a difference between our army and 
marines because our marines are seen as commandos i dont see the difference 
between your army and marines though? someone enlighten me 
@palehorseridder ok then, i will just ignore the war in the Pacific and the 
Philippine American war.
Real Modern Warfare
The difference between the Army and The Marine Corps is that the Marines 
get their orders straight from the president whilst the Army gets theirs 
from our Congress, the Marines are also the ones we send in to do the 
Invasions of countries via coasts because the Marines are an amphibious 
invasion force.
breathtaking
@GambleDwarf100 Whatever kid...I did my time in Afghanistan, worked with 
10th MTN, CJSOT-F, and 2-8 Marines while I was there. I'd like to see you 
stand out in front of me at 500 yards once, it wouldn't be the best day of 
your life. I'll let you go back to talking about things you know nothing 
about now, have fun.
To all those who like watching war documentary's there is a Danish movie 
called ''Armadillo'' it's like this movie it in the Helman province. I can 
really only reconmend it.
All I can honestly say is: THIS MOVIE IS WORTH THE WATCH.
I find it funny how those who have never been to Afghanistan say some of 
the most shit about the U.S military and the army palehorse and dmharvey 
when you stop playing call of duty and actually have the balls to serve 
your country then shut the fuck up. I did CCT for the airforce in the 
Kandahar Valley. I served with some of the toughest army men. so how before 
you say something dont talk 
@MrBluenano you just now have the same respect for the Army as you do the 
Marines? I'm being objective in saying "what did the Marine Corps do to

@palehorseridder Umm, bud. I never once said i was in the United States 
Marine Corps. Maybe you misunderstood when i stated that these soldiers are 
in the Corps. Learn to read genius. haha. I NEVER said i was in 
Afghanistan, can you please tell me when i stated that I served in country? 
Fucking genius aren't we?

Our teacher just showed us this film, and I think it's GREAT. It's like 
squeezing the truth out of these filthy wall streeters and policy makers 
until they can not hide their dirty business.
I didn't believe in conspiracy, and I was wrong. Wall Street is EVIL, 
really EVIL.﻿
Why does anyone still invest in Goldman's (nut)Sachs?  They should take 
away the $100 billion the company is playing with now and give it to all 
the people who got cheated by Goldman Sucks.﻿
YIFY baby﻿
Untill we use Citizen Power & arrest all these crooks, the world will be 
going to shit.. The current "Financial" system should be taken apart brick 
by brick.. all those who made other peoples lives worse should be held 
accountable.. after the whole "House" is ripped apart & all the "Fat Cats" 
are safely locked away, a new system, without Wall Street trading, actually 
without any "fantasy" trading, should be put into effect.. The ONLY trades 
that should transpire is physically tangible ones.. where people trading 
would know what their trading & what their buying.. where "money" would be 
supported by Resources.. every dollar should be held against either food.. 
or gold.. or wood.. makes no difference as long as it's NOT "Legal 
Tender".. If it were up to me Monetary System would be dissolved all 
together, & a Resource Based Economy put into effect.. But, lets say 
humanity "can't" live without Capitalism.. fine, but root-out false 
trading.. no more selling "debt", or some imagined "equity".. Make ALL 
money accountable, so that it wouldn't be created from thin air..
Unfortunately for the time being these Financiers are in control of our 
planet.. as long as they control the money flow, they control governments, 
they create the industry, they create the media.. The only salvation in 
this debacle would be some "miracle" disappearance of Main Heads of these 
Banking Cartels & dissolution of Capitalist Monetary Unit.. only then, & 
only if people won't flip-out and go animalistic, a new system can be put 
in place.. if one of the factors isn't in place, it would go back as it 
was, so both need to happen at the same time..﻿
Housing market wasn't due to deregulation. There were 42 regulating 
agencies at the time for the crash. The Fed lowered interest rates 11 times 
making is easy for banks to lend money to each other plus the government

From Academy Award® nominated filmmaker, Charles Ferguson ("No End In 
Sight"), comes INSIDE JOB, the first film to expose the shocking truth 
behind the economic crisis of 2008. The global financial meltdown, at a 
cost of over $20 trillion, resulted in millions of people losing their 
homes and jobs. Through extensive research and interviews with major 
financial insiders, politicians and journalists, INSIDE JOB traces the rise 
of a rogue industry and unveils the corrosive relationships which have 
corrupted politics, regulation and academia. Narrated by Academy Award® 
winner Matt Damon, INSIDE JOB was made on location in the United States, 
Iceland, England, France, Singapore, and China.﻿
Yet another inception film from our masters to fool us in to a false sense 
of normalised satisfaction so that we don't blame any one tribe of people 
just the BANKERS. Yep it's just the bankers, no one else, it must be the 
bankers who hold back the cancer cures and promote the porn industry and 
created the term multiculturalism. O and invented communism and own 
Hollywood and run our media and instruct every government on earth with 
exception to Iran and Syria, not bad for just 18million people. ﻿
We people, do not deserve this. ﻿
Its a mistake to think this is just a Wall St issue or a modern issue.﻿
If you want to know the truth regarding why we are in the economic 
situation that we are in, watch this award-winning documentary (narrated by 
Matt Damon). This was eye-opening, infuriating, and incredibly informative! 
I highly recommend this documentary! Some of the key people responsible for 
our devastated economy were key advisers under Reagan, Bush, Clinton, and 
Bush - and many of these same people serve currently under Obama. It's a 
travesty. ﻿
MrPrizeorbit, everyone has a right to their own opinion, even airheads like 
you!!!﻿
The conclusion for this documentary= Obama "change" campaign in 2008 does 
not change at all!!!﻿
I think if the forefathers of this country time traveled here and saw what 
the leaders are doing to the country and its people they would fall into 
despair and depression.

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. This concept, this ideal, this dream. I fear that 
people no longer know what it is, what it's about, or how to aspire to it. 
Even if people knew, we can't afford to do anything about it. Such sadness.﻿
1000$ per hour,yeah American dream,funny is that I have 3.25$ per hour and 
I should I be happy that I have job at all,man fuck this life,this isn't 
living this is surviving...﻿
Documentaries I watched. Inside Job is one that I highly recommend.
Winter 2014 ﻿
It's abnomalies. It's fucking ridiculous. People wake up. It's serious. 
This is not just for US. it's probably happening in anywhere in globe. 
Please if anyone hasn't watched this please please do. It's disgusting 
world and I only hope that people realize what meets the eyes is not all 
you see.﻿
Great documentary. Heard the budget was around $20.000.000.000.000, though.﻿
after watching this documentary I realized it was useless hopping that the 
US government would stop the drone attacks that are killing thousands of 
innocent civilians in my country(pakistan) ,yemen and somalia, when they 
have absolutely no qualms about defrauding and making thousands of their 
own people jobless and homeless. you cant expect anything from such a 
Government.﻿
Now where does Jordan Belfort fit in all this ?﻿
I am a documentary addict. Anything about wallstreet, money, sex, drugs, 
violence, prostitution, war.... I can't get enough of it.﻿
Finally got around to watching "The Inside Job" on Netflix last night. A 
scathing expose of the greed, recklessness and self-dealing that led to the 
2008 global financial meltdown. How none of the banking, insurance or 
rating agency executives ended up being arrested, arraigned or convicted is 
even more shocking. Well worth watching.﻿
I assume many of us watched this documentary ...just in case for those who 
didnt..﻿
I think some points are quite shady when it comes to explaining WS people's 
behavior. However, this is a piece of work. And it certainlyforces us to 
think, as economists, about it in a responsible and honest way, as this 
whole issue demands changes in our education and our ability to spread and 
generate knowledge.﻿
Vale la pena, véanla.  Narrada por Matt Damon﻿
Lots and lots of people should watch the "Inside Job" documentary. Very 
informative, very good.﻿

SUCH A BEAUTIFUL DOCUMENTARY!!! Loved it....
5/5 stars :-)
Everyone should watch this. Cheers.﻿

Waste Land (2010)
Released on 2010 and premiered in Berlin Film Festival 2010﻿
Don't miss this if you have a chance to see it!﻿
Filmed over nearly three years, WASTE LAND follows renowned artist 
Photographer  Vik Muniz as he journeys from his home base in Brooklyn to 
his native Brazil and the world's largest garbage dump, Jardim Gramacho, 
located on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. There he photographs an 
eclectic band of “catadores”—self-designated pickers of recyclable 
materials. Muniz’s initial objective was to “paint” the catadores with 
garbage. However, his collaboration with these inspiring characters as they 
recreate photographic images of themselves out of garbage reveals both the 
dignity and despair of the catadores as they begin to re-imagine their 
lives. Director Lucy Walker (DEVIL’S PLAYGROUND, BLINDSIGHT and COUNTDOWN 
TO ZERO) and co-directors João Jardim and Karen Harley have great access to 
the entire process and, in the end, offer stirring evidence of the 
transformative power of art and the alchemy of the human spirit.﻿
Looking forward to seeing Wasteland, a documentary about the transformative 
power of art among people who work in the largest landfill in the world 
(thanks to +Nancy White )﻿
‎"Sometimes we see ourselves as so small, but people out there see us as so 
big, so beautiful."﻿
Even though the root cause of the issue has not been addressed in the 
documentary, I highly recommend to watch it. Vic, a brazilian artist living 
in N.Y. brought hope to the small community of pickers.﻿
Vik Muniz makes the world a more beautiful place with trash.  What an 
inspiring artist.  He is one of a kind.﻿
Watching this tonight on Netflix...﻿

Waste Land (2010) - Official Trailer [HD]﻿
This seems like an amazing documentary.﻿
Speaking of photographing the anthropology of workspaces, +Susan Ettenheim +Paul 
Allison +Maria Popova have you seen the movie Waste Land? 
http://www.wastelandmovie.com/﻿
I watched this documentary last week about a NYC-based Brazilian artist, 
Vik Muniz, who travels back to Brazil to create portraits of people who 
make a living gathering recyclable material from a huge landfill/dump near 
Rio. It was inspiring to hear about the lives of these people.﻿
Rush tickets will still be available tonight for the FREE screening of the 
Sundance Film Festival award winner Waste Land- in celebration of the Bloor 
Hot Docs Cinema grand opening. This deeply moving, inspirational story 
about how top selling contemporary artist Vik Muniz changed the lives of 
workers in the world's largest landfill outside Rio de Janeiro is an 
absolute must-see. 
Waste Land (2010) - Official Trailer [HD]﻿
The garbage pickers, the favelas, Jardim Gramacho these are images etched 
in my mind from my early childhood. Decades later, the world is gradually 
looking, listening, thinking... because of the gifted vision of one man: 
Vik Muniz... and an amazing crew of pickers and film folk, all of it 
documented with director Lucy Walker. It came out in 2010... I keep hoping 
word will spread and it will catch fire! 

Abraços a todos!﻿
Fantastic story!﻿
*Watch the Trailer for Waste Land, a Documentary About Beauty and Trash*
"Jardim Gramacho, outside of Rio, is the world's largest landfill. In a new 
documentary called Waste Land, Vik Muniz, a Brazilian-born, Brooklyn-based 
artist, returns to create portraits, made from the trash itself, of the 
so-called "catadores" who work there.

It looks like an interesting peek at a subculture you're not likely to be 
exposed to otherwise, a helpful reminder that we're creating incredible 
volumes of trash, and a nice example of the redemptive power of art."
Waste Land (2010) - Official Trailer [HD]﻿
Awesome 4 some...........﻿
"Waste Land" is an award winning documentary by director Lucy Walker - An 
uplifting feature documentary highlighting the transformative power of art 
and the beauty of the human spirit. Top-selling contemporary artist Vik 
Muniz takes us on an emotional journey from Jardim Gramacho, the world's 
largest landfill on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to the heights of 
international art stardom. Vik collaborates with the brilliant catadores, 
pickers of recyclable materials, true Shakespearean characters who live and 
work in the garbage quoting Machiavelli and showing us how to recycle 
ourselves.

Just enjoyed watching this film. You see this wannabe documentary director 
evolve into a wannabe street artist, all to the bewilderment of the film`s 
intended subject the notorious Banksy. ﻿
I have no recollection why this film ended up in my netflix queue, but it 
must have been a recommendation from someone I know (a student?). In any 
case, interesting.﻿

Looks very interesting. I want to see this documentary. ﻿
Quite good/sad/infuriating look at natural gas exploration and development 
in the last decade. Recently added to Netflix (Canada at least).﻿
the fracking facts﻿
All American Citizens Must See this destruction of our planet for money...
A new grassroots group has formed in Michigan to ban fracking here. Google: 
Don't Frack Michigan 
I dont see how the evidence is "fatally flawed"...in the movie he 
interviewed people who had their water analyzed after having wells 
installed near their homes and they had traces of chemicals used in the 
fracking process. It was right there, on paper, in your face. I just don't 
see how someone can refute that. I guess its just some crazy old 
non-educated country folk with some strange coincidences. Who gives a shit 
what they have to say, right?
Proof Cheney/Bush, the Koch Bros, et al MUST be "destroyed"!!!
@alexdlc69 Glad to see somebody isn't so quick to jump behind this 
documentary.
New York state is now poised to be poisoned. Help ban the process before 
it's too late.
Great distraction and great vide0!! thank u webmovietube
THANK YOU for all your hard work, Josh! We're spreading your message. Keep 
up the good fight. PS next time you go to film a congressional hearing, 
please have a stealth backup camera pal so the info doesn't get lost in our 
sacred "Open Meetings."
Do you believe human beings will still be living on earth in ten thousand 
years ? Well I don't ! Just look at how those bastards are destroying 
everything around us. There have been more environmental disasters in the 
last few years than in the last thirty. Guess why ? Because of money and 
what I call the "Wall Street Bastards". If Al-Qaida brought Wall Street to 
the ground I'd be the first one to say WELL DONE ! 
same BZDURY, nie warto... 
@alexdlc69 The Fukushima accident was caused by a natural disaster, whereas 
fracking is all man made. Very poor example sir. Chernobyl, however, 
wasn't. Yet still if such a comparison was to be made using that as an 
example we would be talking about a couple thousand Chernobyls. Do you 
honestly believe people would be talking about how safe nuclear energy is 
then? Your opinion stinks.
I’ll take big business “gangsters” over the fucking gangster thugs in this 
administration tanking away our liberty faster then they take our money. 
GasLand FULL 1 hour 42 minutes at FullDocumentary [com]
Well I hope I’m wrong but it sounds like you have a problem with any 
industry that makes “billions”.
Spoken like a true brain washed anti-capitalism lib. 
@jon00769 the Fukushima accident was not simply caused by a natural 
disaster. If the plant would have been designed to withstand floods, it 
would have been safe. It was human error that made the plant be unable to 
contain floods. The gas companies could have also made mistakes when 
designing their extraction process. oh, and theres no need to be rude, i 
respect your opinion, so you could atleast try to respect mine.

So far this is pretty amazing.  Streaming on Netflix.﻿
I saw it. It's got some really heavy scenes; especially when he interviews 
people who talk really nonchalantly about killing people. But, overall, it 
was really long and boring.
@tigershot1000 so why you just thank the Cambodia that deny the merits of 
the Vietnam ?
Anyone find a torrent?
how could children for example 10 years old and younger of whom the KR 
murdered by the tens of thousands be considered enemies of the people? 
fuck usa.
@khmerwunder82 Netflix.com
just put more parts of the movie I WANT TO WATCH IT BAD!!!!!!!!!
"I always carried a human gall bladder to sip." Then right after..New York 
Times- "INSPIRING" ha.
this looks SO awesome! Why doesnt this have more views? Jeesh!
this movie is impossible to find.
I lived through the Khmer Rouge and I know how evil and harsh they are to 
innocent people. Many of my family were killed by the Khmer Rouge and they 
are innocent people like the other 2 million dead. At 1:57 "They were 
enemies of the people" in Cambodian literally meaning "doing bad to the 
citizens" ..thats exactly what they did, not we did. At 2:00 he was going 
to say something, but he probably knows he did something wrong so he is 
very secretive. 
its funny ppl try to ignore these things but the plain fact of the matter 
is that our world is a very dark, grim place. There is a hell of a lot more 
bad than there is good. 
 "Enemies of the people" was favorite label during the communistic era used 
by communistic rulers to control population and individuals,those who arise 
the voice not in favor with "communistic line"become immediately 
Enemies,fortunately this is a history !
Very interesting ! Will view ASAP ! 
@theluxifer18 Vietnam definitely helped Cambodia in ridding of the Khmer 
Rouge. Yes atrocities still happened after even through Thai/Vietnamese 
people but the UN is also to blame reinstating the Khmer Rouge as the 
government in power. The US in a way can be held accountable for ignoring 
Cambodia because they were too busy mending their bruised ego after the 
Vietnam War. At the same time, the whole issue is too complex. What we do 
know though is that the Khmer Rouge are the worst humans possible
Enemies of the People is released on 2-disc special edition DVD with over 5 
hours of extras on the 31st October 2011. It will be available to purchase 
on Amazon and the Enemies of the People website. It is also available to 
download on iTunes now.

wheres the fucking doc link ?

@theluxifer18 ?!!
@theluxifer18 That's true, but you forget to point out they only interfered 
because pol pot wanted to reclaim Khmai land that was taken by the 
Vietnamese. It's not like they did it to help the Khmai people, if they 
really wanted to help, it wouldn't have taken 4 years to do so! No matter 
the motive, I still Thank God for the turn of events that helped bring down 
the Khmer Rough. We also Can't forget to Thank All the brave Cambodians who 
fought and gave their lives to do what they knew was Right!

Seriously... People think all Americans are idiots. I guarantee you that's 
bullshit. I know our government is corrupt, I know we're involved in wars 
of deceit and every other corrupt thing this government does like passing 
the NDAA, lying about wmd's in Iraq, lobbying, quantitative easing the 
money supply etc. etc... So you ignorant fucks who blatantly say that line 
"stupid Americans, you government has been Fuck u in ass for long time u so 
stupid" can shut the hell up already. It's annoying!﻿
This documentary is honestly amazing.
Pat Tillman seemed like a courageous, bold, talented individual...but most 
of all as the film tries to show...he was a normal guy.
We can shake our heads and wave our fingers at the government as much as we 
want to...idk if there will ever be a 100% honest relationship between them 
and the public but one thing is for sure...and that is The Tillman Story 
not only accurately portrays the Tillman incident but it is a clear cut 
image of the lengths the government went to deceive is people﻿
@Temple420org go look it up...its all truth.....government dkidnt tell the 
family that he died cuz of another soldier....they told his family it was 
the enemy....pretty shady
@timpani112 Whether he is for or against our military presence in the 
middle east, our soldiers do not have a choice in that and what they have 
to do. So to say that Pat was a sucker is wrong. don't blame our troops for 
what the government decides. And lastly, Freedom is never Free. Every 
American owes their freedom to the men and women that have fought and lost 
there lives so we could have this freedom you think is a right?

@hubertandclyde HAHAHAHAHA! Well to add to my previous statement, that 
right there is what makes this country awesome. Everybody is entitled to 
his/her own opinion. I voiced mine and you've voiced your's. 
@MeketoaI Not the point dumbass.
Stupid Americans...your govt has lied to you since the USS Maine sinking 
story to start the Spanish-American War of 1896. It has been one big lie

posting i thought i had cancelled the first one cuz it was a bit harsk!! 
peace from portugal!!!

@itzme15 that doesn't mean it won't be propoganda
@jkiller990 He was famous in College football he was offered a lucrative 
contract in NFL, then 9'/11 happens, Tillman turns down the contract to 
fight for the US. he gets killed, the media is all over the story, the army 
is too embarassed to tell the real story, due to the media being all over 
the story of his death. so they say some towelheads killed him, when in 
reality they shot at him and his convoy. 
We are in a country and in a world that is being run by unbelievably sick 
people. The chasm between what we’re told is going on and what is really 
going on is absolutely enormous... its actually amzing how true thos words 
are.. we live in a sick sick world..
@nonSteel Micheal Moore movies have a lot of unproven theories, but this 
isn't a conspiracy, its a fact he was killed by friendly fire.Do you really 
think they should had just ignored what really happened and have their son 
used as propaganda?The whole murder plot by the government thing is 
unproven. I'm not liberal nor republican, both parties are responsible for 
where we are today. You need to stop seeing our government as a fairy tale. 
Bush fucked up and Obama's not helping either
@Vega222 hey dickhead the government used his death as a fucking ad to 
recruit more young men to join a worthless fucking cause. The Tillmans knew 
he had a good chance of dying in Afghanistan but when the military covers 
up his REAL cause of death and then uses the bullshit lies as propaganda 
for something that Mr. Tillman himself would not fight for, then they have 
every fucking right to point out these officers and their superiors who 
lied and fucked it all up. You sir are a moron..

this "this is college for you" execute. ﻿

Confidence is good! I believe it's better than to have math and science 
knowledge.﻿
This was one of the most moving documentaries I've ever seen. No matter 
what your feelings about our education system-rankings, charter school ect. 
The thing that matters--the point this documentary is trying to make- is 
that there are children in this nation who need, who WANT a better 
education and a better life and system is failing them.﻿
I want to see this.....﻿
We would ALL love the easy answer; the silver bullet. The problem is not 
'either/or' as in, either the schools or the parenting. It is both. Parents 
in the US enable their children to do 'what feels best' because they are 
afraid to confront and to push. Expecting more from your children has 
become tantamount to 'bullying.' Then you have the schools who have been 
forced to dumb down curriculum so that 'no child is left behind.' Children 
arriving in our schools from other countries, blow by our students because 
their parents expect more... It's WAY more complicated than that. And we're 
in a terrible fix. I don't have the answers. But clearly this film is the 
beginning of a wake-up call.﻿
I think this was a great and very moving documentary about public education 
in the United States.﻿
Amazing documentary you must watch. This shows how eduction system can be 
fixed in US.﻿

Bawled my eyes out watching this documentary on public education.﻿
Waiting for "Superman," is a pretty interesting doc about the complexities 
and struggles of the Public School system and Teachers Unions in America. 
'Bad' Tenured teachers being passed around to different schools is 
basically like pedo priests being past around churches. The kids always 
suffer, and these people keep their jobs, and salaries. Watch it on netflix!

Waiting for Superman Official Trailer﻿
The US comes in second for highest poverty level when compared to like 
countries. studies have been done that prove that if all levels of poverty 
were equal, the US would be ranked in the top 3 in both reading and math. 
this anti-public education video uses the well-grown misconception that 
public schools are failing as a way to make room for charter 
schools....follow the money. who profits from charter school? research 
supports the fact that charter school students do not perform better than 
public school students. charter schools are also able to hand-pick their 
students and expel for ANY reason. learning disability? good-bye. behavior 
issues? so long, farewell. ESL? adios. 

PLEASE DO NOT BELIEVE THE PROPAGANDA THAT IS BEING SPEWED BY PEOPLE WHO 
HOPE TO BENEFIT FROM THE NOTION THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE FAILING. ﻿

Does anyone find it ironic that one of the "education reformers" in this

year?" ﻿
In reply to KingTeshub...really? stick to the facts, avoid racism.
what is the percentage of poverty in the US in comparison to the leading 
countries? this country is scapegoating teachers as the cause of societal 
problems. More and more kids are coming to school having never held a 
scissors, who don't own a book, and who have uneducated, mentally ill, 
and/or drug abusing parent/s. some of them come to school hungry or tired 
because of something that occurred in their house the previous night. some 
are homeless. some/many come to school abused and neglected. we do not take 
care of the mentally ill and impoverished people in this country. shame on 
us. teachers are not miracle workers, but i have seen some pretty amazing 
things happen in my career as a result of passionate, loving teachers. 
people who are in this profession are in it because it is a calling, not 
because of the riches (ha) we make. ﻿
The American Teachers Unions should profusely apologize for the enormous 
damage they've done and spend the rest of their lives working to rectify 
their malicious behavior. But they won't. In fact, they won't even admit 
that they've done a thing wrong. :-(

You guys do know that you're complete strangers who have nothing to hate 
each other for right? I mean, seriously, look as you guys, fighting on 
youtube like little girls. I bet my fuckin nut sack that if you guys met at 
a convention of similar interest, you'd drink beers together and be 
friends. Fucking jerkoffs. Never a shortage of you guys in the world to 
keep hate alive. Congrats.
Phenomenal film. . .just watched it yesterday. . .It gives me so much hope 
to know there are people like Shlomi and Dr. Somech working hard for 
humanity in such a horrible circumstance. We all can learn so much from 
these people. . .praying for peace, equality and a resolution to the plight 
of the Palestinians and Israelis . . .and full-access to the Holy Land for 
all our lifetimes 
I hope that one day Israel and Palestine can live in peace.. so they fell 
and share Jerusalem as the blessing from God.... I hope i can get this 
movie in Indonesia soon.... 
FREE PALESTINE
i was told that wrong can't last forever yeah am talking about u israel 
...... you are doomed 
Israel wont stop bombing till they give up ;') and stop their shitty terror 
I watched this earlier today. Powerful, brilliant documentary. Loved it. 
And baby Muhammed was just adorable.
@QUEENSLOVER545 Israel's bombing and ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, 
Operation Cast Lead, killed 1,417 Palestinians; thirteen Israelis were 
killed, five by friendly fire. Thousands of Palestinians were seriously 
wounded and left without adequate medical care, shelter or food. Among the 
Palestinian dead, more than 400 were children.
religion 
OMG! finally something that doesn't condemn Israel! Yay! I'm so proud to be 
a Jew supporting these people who do such wonderful things! When will it 
air in the US? 
@bluelight705 This isnt initially about religion. Its about land. The 
israelis and the palestinians are fighting over Gaza, and Jerusalem, which 
is holy to both Judaism and Islam. 
Maybe someone should tell you that you don't spell babies with a 'y'.
@abughaben The only disgusting thing about this is the ingratitude 
expressed by the baby's poor, deluded mother. I pray he doesn't follow her 
example.
There is nothing beautiful about war that could have been avoided. For 
those who lives in the real world... wake up and see what the great U.S 
wanted and did to both guilty and innocent. 
@OddSeuss what makes any human so important to save? 
these people beleive in sky gods, they are all fucking crazy. We need to 
stop giving israel billions.
What make the baby so important to save?
@pastnewsfreek18431 u dont get it that is what im talking about they do 
have better rights then most isreali folks ... and then they donete most of 
ther money to hizzbala and leave the hose with the free water (that isreali 
pay X3 more for)...
@haaloverbugg You're a gigantic douche... You seriously are... 
I only pray that this movie will help open people eyes
@katydid26 it's been a year, do you still think america will release this?
Shalom Israel. Entiendan no importa si somos Enemigos Los Amamos y todo lo 
k hacemos es anonimo de corazon. We Love You do not be ignorant. We Love 
You.
This has been showing on HBO for a couple of months. For those of you who 
think the mother's view of life and the Israelis didn't change by the end 
of the movie, you weren't paying attention. Neither were those who think 
she plans to raise her son to be a suicide bomber. She said those things to 
protect herself from her own people who trash-talked her for going to 
Israel to save her child. This film shows a more human aspect of the 
Israel-Palestinian conflict that we in the US never get to see.
@MrFBI78 why did you just refer to your own mother as a whore? That is 
weirdddddddddddd
I had the chance to see the movie Thursday, IMAJ organised the viewing and 
Schlomi was present. An excellent journalist and a privilege to hear him 
speak about his experiences and explanations about how he sees a future 
Israel and Gaza. Go see the films and make up your own mind!

So saddening to see more than 250 dolphins captured for slaughter or sale 
in Japan's killing cove http://virg.in/dij﻿
People talk about hunting and its legality and that this movie is 
hypocrisy. Fight your battles!! Its not like tomorrow people can end 
hunting, but we can end this dolphin genocide today! Just as hunting has 
it's laws and restrictions and they are enforced so does fishing! If the 
killing of dolphins is illegal then it should be stopped just like 
pouching. Plus proper "hunting" is not rounding up all the deer or whatever 
in a small area and then blowing them away!﻿
Stop it with these horrible comments. Not all of Japan know about this, it 
clearly shows in the trailer. ﻿
Death to Japanese! This time drop a bigger bomb on them!!﻿
shut the down!﻿
I beg you! 
Protection lovely them.
﻿
You idiots are so surprised by this and say Japan should be wiped off this 
earth yet you sit there and let hunting be legal, hunting is killing of 
animals for no reason, wasting their body (Not eating it) and hanging their 
head up on a wall for a sense of accomplishment.﻿
I'm Japanese. I have questions for anti whaling. WHY only killing whale to 
eat is bad? WHY do you think hunting deer and bear for fun is not bad in 
your countly? how do you know whale is intelligent as human. deer and bear 
are also intelligent. the value of lives depend on their IQ? have you ever 
seen cattle, pigs and bards are killed?
you only saw Japanese fisher men killing dolphins and think Japanese is 
cruel. it's not fair. this is the local's culture. you don't have the right 
to change their custom. please respect our culture. ﻿
Japanese need to disappear of this planet. ﻿
There are some people on this epic fail of an earth that have no respect... 
If only humans had hearts like dolphins or loving dogs... This place would 
be so much better... :(﻿
The Japs have no respect for the eco system.﻿
I have good news that season of killing the dolphins is over in 4 days but 
then it will sadly start again which is a very teribble thought ﻿
Also for a country that considers this a cultural way of life, need I 
remind you that this happens in japan 
http://global3.memecdn.com/Meanwhile-in-Japan_o_106998.jpg﻿
God what the fuck is wrong with these fishermen were they constructed in a 
lab to be emotionless and kill kill kill .Honestly the scientific research 
cover up is bullSHIT utter BULLSHIT !!!! Might aswell say it right now 
HUMANS are only interested in HUMANS it's like there's only a 1.9999 
percent that actually cares about something other than humans.I'm 
dissappointed in my generation where it's all about social media and I'm 
only 12 and starting to realize what a fudged up world I live in . ﻿
Now I'm not saying everyone in those parts are to blame, it's those sick 
minded individuals that need help! Why do that!!! What the hell do you get 
out of it??!!! ﻿
stop killing animals.not only Japan.
Americans.stop killing humans ﻿
The sickest places that have no respect or compassion for animals are 
Japan, China, Canada and the Philippines. It's sick what they do to 
animals, why, I always ask why would they ever treat an animal like that. 
What has this world come to? I don't understand the need to kill and treat 
animals like that. Leave them alone! They're where they belong! Let them 
live in peace for once! They're not hurting anyone, those people are! A lot 
of people say we should fear animals, but the real monsters are the humans 
who do this, and those who do not care, and do nothing to stop it! ﻿
To the person who said Japanese people should be wiped off the planet- I 
think the human race should be wiped out. All we do is take and destroy and 
hardly anyone cares. ﻿
Their is no hope for humans.﻿
This human psychopathic action against mother nature has not been fixed 
since the release of this movie. What does this say about hope? There is 
none. This problem could have been fixed by people refusing to eat dolphin 
meat. What does it say about ordinary people? There are just too many bad 
people walking on this planet.﻿
asari shut up u Japanese cunt﻿
i hate japanse people for doing this. poor creaters.﻿
we need to nuke japan again, we need to chop off their tiny little jap 
dicks to make the japs understand the pain that they have inflicted on the 
baby whales and dolphins﻿
So sad they should not be killing dolphins they're going to be so sad if 
people were killing the Japanese people who r killing the dolphin uhhhhh I 
hate them﻿
i love dolphins but i am truly scared to see this movie. should i watch it?﻿
$$$$
Its sad that we now know the entire thing was a pack of lies and a cash 
grab created by Steven Donziger and his fellow lawyers﻿
Wednesday night video viewing in Brisbane: Crude, The Real Price of Oil. 
View trailer: http://youtu.be/duFXuRnd2CU﻿
Excellent idea re: +Gabriel Fiorini's suggestion to post 
conservation-themed documentaries that have inspired us. One of the 
documentaries that I found in the past few years has been "Crude". It tells 
the story of lawyers from both Ecuador and the US whom represented local 
tribes in a class-action lawsuit against Chevron over the contamination of 
the Ecuadorian Amazon.
CRUDE - Official Trailer﻿
A very powerful and important film ... A must see for anyone concerned 
about the lungs of the planet "the rain-forest"

CRUDE - Official Trailer﻿
Texaco=Chevron=Rockefeller=Rotschild This is sick, the same who are fucking 
the enviroment now make videos to save it, wake up sheep.
the earth is going the way of those poison pits. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE. STOP 
THIS MADNESS. Beat back the greedy pigs. Buy less crap and live with less. 
This is true wealth

global warming is not cause by co2 BUT these petroleum corp. are surely 
corrupt, polluting the environment and killing innocents with their action. 
Guess who control the petroleum industry? THE BANKSTERS guess who control 
world politics? THE BANKSTERS World gov and centralization of power is here 
to have a new world order. Wake up others before its to late.
@thefutureisvegan Nice job of diverting the topic in an effort to 
pontificate on your own perspective. Get off your soapbox and have a 
cheeseburger.
PEACE & TRUTH
Why are all of the oil companies so currupt? They dont give a s**t about 
people, money hungry bastards. All people in the world deserve life over 
money. END OF STORY!
I could never be a spokesman for an oil company.
Obama is a MORON, Imagine how much HEMP could help out a) this area b) the 
US economy, and we would fin need Cheveron or Texaco....f those big oil 
co's who make RECORD PROFITS EVERY SINGLE YEAR!!!!
Come on, you oil companies are destroying the environment, including the 
ocean. You think anyone is going to believe you're innocent? It's only a 
matter of wondering what we can do about, not whether you are guilty or not.
La de Chavez es "South of The Border", igual tienes que verla para que 
juzgues por ti mismo.
This is the war we should be fighting...These rich corporate scum-bags are 
killing the earth...then what ? Is that why we explore other planets to 
leave this one a disaster and move on? 
go get em!! Take em down!!!
Fuck Texaco!!!
The pollution speaks for itself. Chevron messed up big time, now they have 
to man up, pay up and try to improve there dire pollution record. We all 
know oil companies want as much profit as possible, that’s there game. The 
pollution that oil exploration is responsible for ‘should’ in an ideal 
world be cleaned up by responsible companies. If not, they should be forced 
(legally) to clear up there mess. 
These oil whore were the ones who built this century, and not only that, 
but also these oil whores are indirectly feeding the third world countries 
by giving them a place in the biggest industry of earth. Also, "Crude" is a 
fraud, it was declared hoax in seven courts in the US and a also in the 
Haya court, in the behind scenes all the dudes in this hoax actually admit 
it. I invite you to actually make some research before posting dumb 
comments on YouTube
actually..the primitive babylonian economic system is the problem .. 
especially the banking sector.. pure evil!
They got sued, they just have been avoiding it for over 20 years
@thefutureisvegan When you have nothing but bread, water, no computer to 
type your opinions online, and a hut, get back to me how great this new 
boring funless life is. 
poor sanitation? jajaja esa mujer no sabe nada, tienen que hacer algo estan 
robando, saqueando, los recursos naturales de tu pais, los llamados 
democratas capitalistas que venden el petroleo por un precio infimo a un 
alto costo ambiental, social, cultural y economico, con esa riqueza 
petrolera Ecuador podria ser como Suiza. Solo un punado de gente se 
enriquece con los recursos y la salud de un pueblo, saludos de un 
Latinoamericano
I would suggest everyone watch the DVD version, because in the Extras 
section, there is a press junket interview, where some poignant thoughts 
are voiced. Let's be aware. Aja aja!
